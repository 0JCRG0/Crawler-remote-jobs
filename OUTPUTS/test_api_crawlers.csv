Benefits impact how we act rest grieve set boundaries and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company but a mentally well society. At Real we want to offer our employees more than just permission to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work. _Payout_ - Competitive salary plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you. _Healthcare for Full-Time Employees:_ - 100% company-funded health vision and dental insurance for our employees. That means no monthly premiums coming out of your paycheck. - FSA plans - Free One Medical membership - Free Real membership - $1800 annual mental wellness stipend you can put toward therapy psychiatry fitness and other wellness services - Short- and long-term disability coverage - Life insurance _Retirement for Full-Time Employees_ - 401(k) — we don’t match yet but you’ll thank us for the compound interest later. _Vacation_ - Unlimited PTO…that we actually encourage you to take we promise. _Rest_ - Four day work weeks Monday-Thursday - Four-week paid sabbatical after five continuous years of work at Real. _Floating Holidays_ - Three floating holidays in addition to company-wide federal holidays so you can celebrate what’s important to you. _Grief Break_ - Real employees receive two weeks of paid time off in the event of losing a loved one. We know grief doesn’t have an end date and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work. _Parenthood_ - Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy. _Autonomy_ - Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM go for it. - Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC you’re 100% part of the team. - Autonomous work culture. We don’t have to see a green dot on Slack to trust that you’re doing your job. _Growth at Work_ - We invest in your career. Our companys growing quickly and well give you the opportunity to do the same. Youll have access to a number of professional development opportunities so that you can keep up with the companys evolving needs and grow your career along the way.

Local-first Software Developer,https://4dayweek.io/remote-job/local-first-software-developer-electric-sql,#### Local-first Software Developer (Elixir/Typescript) ###### €35 000 - €50 000 \| 0.025% \| Remote occasional on-site in Europe We’re looking for a junior to mid-level developer to join our core team to help develop ElectricSQL’s local-first software platform integrations and example applications. You’ll be working full-stack to build reactive realtime offline capable applications with the ElectricSQL system. You’ll contribute generally to developing the core ElectricSQL platform. And you’ll develop framework integrations such as reactive hooks for different front-end frameworks and DSLs for different back-end migration systems. You need to be a natural developer with great coding and communication skills. That needs to be backed up by at least 2 years’ professional software development experience. You must be proficient with Typescript the unix command line front-end build systems and at least one server-side language (that isn’t Javascript). It would be great if you’ve worked with relational database modelling. Ideally you’ve designed built and operated full stack systems yourself. Really you should have evidence of previous projects and open source contributions. It’s a generalist role. You’ll need to think about product developer engagement onboarding and usability as well as coding. It would be great if you also enjoy writing and advocacy. It’s also important to understand the environment you’ll be joining. We are a small distributed team of experienced technologists many of whom are world experts in their domain building an open source devtools startup. There’s lots of technical guidance and mentoring available. With people like the inventors of CRDTs and the creator of the Elixir programming language on team to work with and learn from. However we do not have many of the structured processes support and management mechanisms that you’ll find in a larger company. You have to be able to thrive on your own initiative communicate effectively ask the right questions provide clarity as much as you demand it and get stuff done in the presence of uncertainty. So one of the key things we’re looking for (and will select for) is the ability to be pro-active and self-managing. We’re an open source project so here’s a clue: applying for the job with a well written personalised email is not the only opportunity you have to impress us right now.,2023-06-05,NaN,2023-06-05 12:55:28.455464
Senior Frontend Engineer,https://4dayweek.io/remote-job/senior-frontend-engineer-electric-sql,#### Senior Frontend Engineer (Typescript) ###### €80 000 - €100 000 \| 0.1 - 0.2% \| Remote occasional on-site in Europe We’re looking for an experienced front-end developer to join our core team to help develop the ElectricSQL local-first software platform. Your focus will be to develop our client-side components starting with our Typescript client. This is the primary developer touchpoint of the ElectricSQL system and includes APIs for authentication database driver integration component framework integrations and systems for reactivity and dynamic partial replication. Take a look at the code at electric-sql/electric/tree/maiclients/typescript(https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/maiclients/typescript) and watch this talk(http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sn_Ig5n2Oc0) to see where things are going. The work isn’t about building an application. It’s about crafting an open-source platform for other software developers to use that systemically solves the state transfer problem for local-first application development. Obviously you have extremely strong front-end development skills. Ideally you’ve worked as a tech lead and system architect. Naturally you’ve worked with a range of different reactive component frameworks. You’re experienced with a range of data modelling and state management techniques including relational data modelling and offline-first architectures. It would be great if you’ve worked with ORMs and query builders complex types and ideal if you’ve developed and maintained open source libraries. We have native framework integrations and we’re extracting our core client-side replication component to Rust for cross-environment portability and compilation to WASM. So any experience with Rust WASM mobile app development Swift Kotlin Dart Flutter React Native Expo would all also be very helpful and relevant. You must be able to demonstrate experience in a range of different professional settings and the ability to thrive in an early stage startup environment. (You don’t have to have worked at a startup but we need a clear indication that you’re going to thrive at this one). Finally it’s important that you’re genuinely motivated by the opportunity to invest your time and energy into building an open source platform that helps replace today’s siloed exploitative cloud-first systems with local-first software. Not only for the UX cost and reliability benefits but also for the ethical aspects of user ownership and privacy by design.,2023-06-05,NaN,2023-06-05 12:55:28.455466
