comesWhats a SilverfinAt Silverfin were trying to apply the promise of software to the ageold industry of accounting With our SaaS were automating a large chunk of the busywork that accountants are currently handling manually and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers the business ownersThe good news is were succeeding in doing exactly that Every week more than 15000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400000 businesses Our customers adore us The even better news is theres still plenty left to work on and thats where we hope you come inWhats the product team likeThe product team is a crossfunctional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers The teams input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved The setup of the team is largely based on the book Inspired by Marty Cagan What does working at Silverfin look likeThe product team will work together with the other Silverfin engineering teams While the product team is set up as a streamaligned team most other teams are set up as platform teams around modules and topics of the Silverfin application They are helping the streamaligned team to develop solutions fast and without a lot of mental overhead The platform teams focus is the stability and long term architecture of the product as well as building frameworks and libraries that can be used by the stream aligned team If those terms are not familiar to you check out the Team Topologies book by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton which inspired this structure Our ops team ensures things run smoothly deploys happen correctly and will work with you when issues should arise Were enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset which means ops and developers work together to solve problems and empower eachother to be selfsufficient instead of throwing problems over the wall to the other sideWe run an uptodate Rails monolith on the backend with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud Our daily tools include GitLab Quip and Slack with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice No code gets deployed without a codereview by a peer and testing is a must Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green and deploys happen dozens of times a day Each team is currently doing Kanban but theyre free to follow whatever process suits them best There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvementSoftware for accountants is not considered to be very exciting but we have our fair share of technical challenges To give you a sense of scale our database exceeds 10TB and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back We interface with more than 30 different external APIs and provide third parties an API of our own Our ops team noted that this actually isnt that hard to achieve if youre just indexing everything but it still sounds impressive rightWhat makes the engineering team at Silverfin specialWere a remotefirst engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents A priority for us is maintaining proper worklife balance We avoid meetings as much as possible accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary and never expect anyone to work longer hours than theyve signed up for A day in our working lives is pretty boring and we feel thats exactly how it should beWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule Its OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands get a haircut pick up the kids  whatever reason you dont need to explain yourself You also fully decide when you take time off our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load and in the rare cases its not we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holidayBeing remotefirst means we favour asynchronous communication We dont shy away from chatting in Slack but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues over email or in Quip so theres a written persisted record Were mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time which means we avoid mentions or PMs on Slack and other triggers and interrupts We encourage using Slacks DnD function especially when youre not workingWed be really happy to welcome you in our engineering channel but its not just virtual we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too Twice a year we
