software development team focused on Proof of Stake infrastructure for public blockchain networks Specific topics of focus are Internet Bonds Distributed Validator Technology and MultiOperator Validation The core team includes 14 members spread across 8 countriesThe core team is building the Obol Network a protocol to foster trustminimized staking through multioperator validation This will enable lowtrust access to Ethereum staking yield which can be used as a core building block in various Web3 productsThe NetworkThe network can be best visualized as a work layer that sits directly on top of the base layer consensus This work layer is designed to provide the base layer with more resiliency and decentralization as it scales In this chapter of Ethereum we will move on to the next great scaling challenge which is stake centralization Layers like Obol are critical to the longterm viability and resiliency of public networks especially networks like EthereumObol as a layer is focused on scaling main chain staking by providing permissionless access to Distributed Validators The network utilizes a middleware implementation of Distributed Validator Technology DVT to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters that can preserve validators current client and remote signing configurationsSimilar to how rollup technology laid the foundation for L2 scaling implementations we believe DVT will do the same for scaling the consensus layer while preserving decentralization Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution which must include trustminimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security resiliency and decentralization of public networksThe Obol Network develops and maintains four core public goods that will eventually work together through circular economicsThe DV Launchpad a User Interface for bootstrapping and managing Distributed ValidatorsCharon a middleware Golang client that enables validators to run in a faulttolerant distributed mannerObol Managers a set of solidity libraries for the formation of Distributed Validators tailored to different use cases such as DeFi Liquid Staking and Fractionalized Deposits Obol Testnets a set of ongoing public incentivized testnets that enable any sized operator to test their deployment before serving for the Ethereum Main netSustainable Public GoodsObol is inspired by previous work on Ethereum public goods and experimenting with circular economics We believe that to unlock innovation in staking use cases a credibly neutral layer must exist for innovation to flow and evolve vertically Without this layer highly available uptime will continue to be a moatThe Obol Network will become an open communitygoverned selfsustaining project over the coming months and years Together we will incentivize build and maintain distributed validator technology that makes public

implementation of Distributed Validator Technology DVT to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters that can preserve validators current client and remote signing configurationsSimilar to how rollup technology laid the foundation for L2 scaling implementations we believe DVT will do the same for scaling the consensus layer while preserving decentralization Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution which must include trustminimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security resiliency and decentralization of public networksThe Obol Network develops and maintains four core public goods that will eventually work together through circular economicsThe DV Launchpad a User Interface for bootstrapping and managing Distributed ValidatorsCharon a middleware Golang client that enables validators to run in a faulttolerant distributed mannerObol Managers a set of solidity libraries for the formation of Distributed Validators tailored to different use cases such as DeFi Liquid Staking and Fractionalized Deposits Obol Testnets a set of ongoing public incentivized testnets that enable any sized operator to test their deployment before serving for the Ethereum Main netSustainable Public GoodsObol is inspired by previous work on Ethereum public goods and experimenting with circular economics We believe that to unlock innovation in staking use cases a credibly neutral layer must exist for innovation to flow and evolve vertically Without this layer highly available uptime will continue to be a moatThe Obol Network will become an open communitygoverned selfsustaining project over the coming months and years Together we will incentivize build and maintain distributed validator technology that makes public networks a more secure and resilient foundation to build on top ofObol is looking for a Finance Associate to help support the founders

a remotefirst research and software development team focused on Proof of Stake infrastructure for public blockchain networks Specific topics of focus are Internet Bonds Distributed Validator Technology and MultiOperator Validation The core team includes 14 members spread across 8 countriesThe core team is building the Obol Network a protocol to foster trustminimized staking through multioperator validation This will enable lowtrust access to Ethereum staking yield which can be used as a core building block in various Web3 productsThe NetworkThe network can be best visualized as a work layer that sits directly on top of the base layer consensus This work layer is designed to provide the base layer with more resiliency and decentralization as it scales In this chapter of Ethereum we will move on to the next great scaling challenge which is stake centralization Layers like Obol are critical to the longterm viability and resiliency of public networks especially networks like EthereumObol as a layer is focused on scaling main chain staking by providing permissionless access to Distributed Validators The network utilizes a middleware implementation of Distributed Validator Technology DVT to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters that can preserve validators current client and remote signing configurationsSimilar to how rollup technology laid the foundation for L2 scaling implementations we believe DVT will do the same for scaling the consensus layer while preserving decentralization Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution which must include trustminimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security resiliency and decentralization of public networksThe Obol Network develops and maintains four core public goods that will eventually work together through circular economicsThe DV Launchpad a User Interface for

economics We believe that to unlock innovation in staking use cases a credibly neutral layer must exist for innovation to flow and evolve vertically Without this layer highly available uptime will

were trying to apply the promise of software to the ageold industry of accounting With our SaaS were automating a large chunk of the busywork that accountants are currently handling manually and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers the business ownersThe good news is were succeeding in doing exactly that Every week more than 15000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400000 businesses Our customers adore us The even better news is theres still plenty left to work on and thats where we hope you come inWhats the product team likeThe product team is a crossfunctional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers The teams input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved The setup of the team is largely based on the book Inspired by Marty Cagan What does working at Silverfin look likeThe product team will work together with the other Silverfin engineering teams While the product team is set up as a streamaligned team most other teams are set up as platform teams around modules and topics of the Silverfin application They are helping the streamaligned team to develop solutions fast and without a lot of mental overhead The platform teams focus is the stability and long term architecture of the product as well as building frameworks and libraries that can be used by the stream aligned team If those terms are not familiar to you check out the Team Topologies book by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton which inspired this structure Our ops team ensures things run smoothly deploys happen correctly and will work with you when issues should arise Were enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset which means ops and developers work together to solve problems and empower eachother to be selfsufficient instead of throwing problems over the wall to the other sideWe run an uptodate Rails monolith on the backend with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud Our daily tools include GitLab Quip and Slack with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice No code gets deployed without a codereview by a peer and testing is a must Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green and deploys happen dozens of times a day Each team is currently doing Kanban but theyre free to follow whatever process suits them best There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvementSoftware for accountants is not considered to be very exciting but we have our fair share of technical challenges To give you a sense of scale our database exceeds 10TB and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back We interface with more than 30

rightWhat makes the engineering team at Silverfin specialWere a remotefirst engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents A priority for us is maintaining proper worklife balance We avoid meetings as much as possible accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary and never expect anyone to work longer hours than theyve signed up for A day in our working lives is pretty boring and we feel thats exactly how it should beWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule Its OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands get a haircut pick up the kids  whatever reason you dont need to explain yourself You also fully decide when you take time off our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load and in the rare cases its not we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holidayBeing remotefirst means we favour asynchronous communication We dont shy away from chatting in Slack but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues over email or in Quip so theres a written persisted record Were mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time which means we avoid mentions or PMs on Slack and other triggers and interrupts We encourage using Slacks DnD function especially when youre not workingWed be really happy to welcome you in our engineering channel but its not just virtual we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too Twice a year we fly the whole engineering

the core growth engine of the businessThis is not your typical marketing role You wont be trying to prove 5 improvements across 8 different channels You wont be pumping more and more money into ads to hit a monthly target You wont be churning out SEO content or gated ebooks Instead youll be hunting for Podias biggest growth opportunities regardless of what channel they can be found inThe right person for this role is a generalist and an ongoing student of marketing You may have come up through content product marketing or growth but your focus is on finding the bottlenecks of growth and tackling them with whatever tools you have at your disposal With that said here are a few of the ongoing marketing practices you might get involved in  Content After shifting to a freemium model Podias content focus has changed With free accounts the key driver of topoffunnel leads theres less pressure on content to generate leads and more opportunity to drive revenue with a targeted approach to content  LifecycleInapp Podia has some lifecycle in place for freepaid users inactive users and people who take actions in the app  but theres substantial opportunity to get more sophisticated  Community Podias Creator Community has several thousand members and is more active than most SaaS communities But the nature of the creator market means theres still a ton of opportunity to grow  AffiliatesPartnerships The affiliate program relaunched last year and has grown quickly Partnerships with other creator companies have recently begun and are showing promise  CampaignsPrograms Podia runs programs that are just cool Our philosophy more on this below is to use big moments to get the attention that leads to longterm systemic improvements  and that means youll have a ton of freedom

the growth trajectory of an already growing company Youll start with a small team and work with the VP of marketing the marketing team and the rest of the company to make things that matter to creators If youre still interested lets dive inWhy this is a dream marketing opportunityPodia has been growing organically for the last six years and in June 2022 switched from a free trial to a freemium business model Since June weve added tens of thousands of creators and continued to invest in freemium Were growing but there are opportunities to grow faster and better and you could be part of making it possible for anyone to become an online creator From a marketing perspective Podia has grown through a few key channels  Content Content marketing was the first major investment Podia made and theres a strong base of traffic to Podias site as well as a YouTube channel with over 25000 subscribers  Affiliates Podia affiliates drive people to Podias free plan and a recently revamped affiliate program has been scaling quickly  Word of mouth Creators talk to each other a lot A combination of feeding word of mouth via our overall approach to marketing and revamping our pricingpackaging to make Podia more accessible has led to rapid growth  Recently Podia has been investing in integrated campaigns that launch major programs In 2023 Podia is awarding creator fellowships every month of the year  and application to those fellowships is part of how we drive our users to our other work like the multithousand person creator community a usergenerated advice
