is a remotefirst research and software development team focused on Proof of Stake infrastructure for public blockchain networks Specific topics of focus are Internet Bonds Distributed Validator Technology and MultiOperator Validation The core team includes 14 members spread across 8 countriesThe core team is building the Obol Network a protocol to foster trustminimized staking through multioperator validation This will enable lowtrust access to Ethereum staking yield which can be used as a core building block in various Web3 productsThe NetworkThe network can be best visualized as a work layer that sits directly on top of the base layer consensus This work layer is designed to provide the base layer with more resiliency and decentralization as it scales In this chapter of Ethereum we will move on to the next great scaling challenge which is stake centralization Layers like Obol are critical to the longterm viability and resiliency of public networks especially networks like EthereumObol as a layer is focused on scaling main chain staking by providing permissionless access to Distributed Validators The network utilizes a middleware implementation of Distributed Validator Technology DVT to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters that can preserve validators current client and remote signing configurationsSimilar to how rollup technology laid the foundation for L2 scaling implementations we believe DVT will do the same for scaling the consensus layer while preserving decentralization Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution which must include trustminimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security resiliency and decentralization of public networksThe Obol Network develops and maintains four core public goods that will eventually work together through circular economicsThe DV Launchpad a User Interface for bootstrapping and managing Distributed ValidatorsCharon a middleware Golang client that enables validators to run in a faulttolerant distributed mannerObol Managers a set of solidity libraries for the

sized operator to test their deployment before serving for the Ethereum Main netSustainable Public GoodsObol is inspired by previous work on Ethereum public goods and experimenting with circular economics We believe that to unlock innovation in staking use cases a credibly neutral layer must exist for innovation to flow and evolve vertically Without this layer highly available uptime will continue to be a moatThe Obol Network will become an open communitygoverned selfsustaining project over the coming months and years Together we will incentivize build and maintain distributed
