Headquarters Pennsylvania US URL httpswwwskynovacom  Skynova has 60000 happy customers is bootstrapped and debt free What a joy these days  Skynova httpswwwskynovacom provides online invoicing accounting and 30 other business modules to selfemployed and small businesses Our main focus is the US but we have customers from around 100 countries Our customers are very happy The service is easy to use and they get a good selection of tools that they can combine to fit their specific needs  all at a very competitive price point We were founded more than 10 years ago but we think this is just the beginning We have a long list of new modules to create modules to improve core systems to refactor experiments to run data crunching and page loads to speed up and more The more we work on this the more we think of  and our customers have some ideas as well  To step up our efforts we are now looking for Tech Lead to work on all of the above This is a fully remote position so autonomy and independence would be required We collaborate using git jira email google meet and more In addition youll be invited to occasional meetups at the office in Oslo NorwayThere are in total 14 people working here four in the US and ten in EuropeAs a Tech Lead youll be working directly with the CEOfounder who has served as tech lead so far as well as your technical team and others in the company  depending on what needs to be done Our stack is the LAMP stack we use MVC and are moving towards a modular monolith We dont use microservices Kubernetes or complex cloud offerings We try to keep things as simple and stable as possible Boring tech has fewer bugs and requires less maintenance which also equals happy developersYour personal desire should be to strive for simplicity The code base is structured to make it easy to understand and simple to troubleshoot We aim for code readability even if this sometimes means more verbose code We dont code abstract functions trying to anticipate future needs we dont yet know anything about Usually we are wrong about what the future holds and those abstractions make it harder to adapt the code Coding to solve concrete wellknown problems simplifies things both now and in the future Our code architecture is sort of inspired by DDD Each module is loosely coupled and isolated Here is an example of what this might mean in a daily life You need to code something that should cover the needs of 15 scenarios After a week of intense thinking you come up with a single nice function following all best practices that handles it all It will most likely be utterly incomprehensible to anyone but you and you wont understand it yourself after 6 months When a bug surfaces in one of the 15 areas and you fix it you end up breaking three of the other scenarios because consequences are hard to predict and see What about the automated tests It passes those with flying colors because the bugs are new Instead your natural inclination and instinct should be to create 15 different functions with a good deal of overlap by violating DRY It is easier to code since you just handle one situation at a time but a bit tedious Others understand it and when something breaks three years down the road a fix only affects the intended area Code review is much easier You will discuss such things with the CEOfounder and part of the role is to protect and promote this architecture  and over time help bring it to the next level You are a responsible person with a keen eye for details When you say a ticket is ready for deployment it means it is ready for deployment Youll ensure that the code has been properly reviewed and that it has been tested Youll need to test critical aspects yourself even if QA says it is ok and it passed automated tests The CEO will deploy the ticket to production Main responsibilities Lead a team of six backend frontend QA  Code review provide feedback to make the pull requests simpler and more readable enforce standards and our code architecture Mentor team members Work on architecture Some coding  Provide architecture suggestions when new modules are to be coded or existing ones refactored Requirements 10 years as a developer  Experience with websaas applications Experience as Tech Lead and  or Architect Excellent communication skills Excellent English skills Excellent writing skills Master  PhD Computer Science Math Physics etc We offer Stable longterm contract Fully remote with occasional meetups Interesting diverse projects High degree of independence and impact Competitive wage EUR 66  USD 73 per hour If you have any questions feel free to ask about anything you want When applying please include both a cover letter and a resumeCV We look forward to hearing from you To
