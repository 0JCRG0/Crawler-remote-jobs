We’re one of the world’s largest  and most successful crypto exchanges, and that involves a responsibility to lead,  advocate, and challenge in the global legal landscape. Among other things, Legal  personnel plan and implement for rapidly evolving bodies of law. They contribute to  product creation and acquisition strategy. They work with prominent customers and legal  bodies worldwide on cutting-edge industry issues and emerging markets.

<p>We are hiring 1-2 engineers as we build Voluntas, a hybrid health tech / crypto company pioneering a new model for patients to interact with clinical research. We’ve secured a few contracts and built a basic MVP already, but these will be our first full time members of the team to focus purely on the technology build.</p>
<p>For the right person with a senior level of experience and drive, we’d bring you on to lead our technology build out and give you a co-founder level of equity / token warrants. We have a strong plan for our product roadmap – involving a simple front-end for patients to register, infrastructure / UI to earn and interact with our token, and so on – and would love for this person to work with us and take ownership over the technical build.</p>
<p>While we could list a tech stack we anticipate you’d likely use, the truth is that we will likely scrap most of our current MVP for the new product you build with us – so you’d be able to guide the stack we utilize. We do anticipate deploying our token on an EVM-compatible chain, so experience with web3 tooling and solidity code is expected. You would work with us across the full scope of our product and have the capability to bring on people to help fill engineering roles as we grow.</p>
<p>If you’re an entry-to-mid level engineer (with experience building crypto apps / coding in solidity), we’d be excited to bring you on to help us build out the product. You’d still get a significant amount of equity / token warrants and the ability to help guide our technology, grow the team, and develop into a leadership role within the company. </p>
<p>Regardless of your experience level, we expect the right person to be execution-oriented, flexible, and excited to work across a range of product areas.</p>
<p>This is a remote position and we’re excited to work with the right people from anywhere. We’re located on the US East Coast, but your schedule is flexible and doesn’t need to match our hours. While we sometimes meet up in person, the company operates remotely. No travel required other than coming to team offsites (likely in the US) around twice a year.</p>
<p>Your total compensation package (cash + equity / token warrants) will depend on the experience you bring and your own preferences.</p>
<p>We expect this to be a full-time commitment (with vacation / time off allowances). This doesn’t mean you can’t be involved in other things, but the expectation is that this is your primary focus. With that said, we do anticipate bringing on limited-term and part-time technical help as well, so if you’re a good fit but only on a short term or part-time basis, please feel free to apply (but let us know that when you contact us).</p>

<p>At Eco, we’re building the future of money. Our mission is to put people’s money back to work for them — letting them see more upside from their money than they do today.</p>
<p>We’ve created the Eco App, a digital wallet that replaces traditional banking services with a single, simple balance, offering users up to 5% APY rewards on their balance and 5% cash back at top merchants like Uber, Amazon, and more. Features like Bill Pay allow our users to put their financial life on autopilot. Even better, we reward every transaction with Eco Points, the world's first open rewards currency, which will fundamentally upgrade traditional money and reimagine how currency flows through the world. Although it may not seem it on the surface, Eco is a crypto-enabled company — and Eco Points will soon be so, too.</p>
<p>Eco is an ambitious company on a mission to make your money work better for you. We need dreamers, doers, creators, and storytellers to help make this vision a reality.

<li>Not be a cog in the machine! We’ll need you to take ownership and work autonomously on initiatives that will span across all facets of Eco</li>
<li>Participate in all product development phases from requirements gathering all the way up to release in production</li>
<li>Champion a remarkable user experience by supporting our user support team in debugging user-facing issues and delivering solutions (a responsibility we take very seriously, and share teamwide)</li>

<p>We’re Coinbase. We’re the world’s most trusted way to join the crypto revolution, serving more than 89 million accounts in more than 100 countries. </p>
<p>Our mission is to <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/our-mission-strategy-and-culture-18a92a3bb0fa"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">increase economic freedom around the world</a>, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web 3.0 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.</p>
<p>There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/culture-at-coinbase-f0e1c2a99aff"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">culture</a> like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">mission-focused approach</a> to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there. </li>
<li>You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0. </li>
<li>You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.</li>
<li>You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.</li>
<li>You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.</li>
<li>You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone. </li>
</ul><p>Every moment matters at Coinbase, big and small. From the first conversation with a recruiter to the first tough moment, big project win, what’s for lunch, the empathy of a manager, how an office feels when you walk in, the sense of belonging you have. All of this is what we mean when we say employee experience. And while the Employee Experience Team doesn’t <em>oversee</em> all elements of employee experience, it includes key pieces (Workplace, BID), drives high-leverage projects (like our work to become a remote-first company), and serves as a strategic partner to leaders across the People Team and enterprise. Everything we do, drive, and recommend is in service of making Coinbase the best crypto company to work for.</p>

<p>We’re Coinbase. We’re the world’s most trusted way to join the crypto revolution, serving more than 89 million accounts in more than 100 countries. </p>
<p>Our mission is to <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/our-mission-strategy-and-culture-18a92a3bb0fa"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">increase economic freedom around the world</a>, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web 3.0 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.</p>
<p>There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/culture-at-coinbase-f0e1c2a99aff"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">culture</a> like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">mission-focused approach</a> to our work.

<p>We’re Coinbase. We’re the world’s most trusted way to join the crypto revolution, serving more than 89 million accounts in more than 100 countries. </p>
<p>Our mission is to <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/our-mission-strategy-and-culture-18a92a3bb0fa"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">increase economic freedom around the world</a>, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web 3.0 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.</p>
<p>There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/culture-at-coinbase-f0e1c2a99aff"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">culture</a> like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our <a href=""https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">mission-focused approach</a> to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture.

You will work closely with Platform leadership and with cross-functional partners from both technical and non-technical backgrounds, partnering with both to push the Platform organization forward.</p>
<p>Successful candidates for this position will be highly logical thinkers, curious learners, and experienced Biz Ops professionals - preferably with broad experience in Biz Ops/Strategy work and with some familiarity for more technical and/or regulated surface areas (payments, infra, etc)</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Partner with our Platform team to determine how to best allocate resources, improve existing processes, and measure effectiveness of the portfolio</li>
<li>Identify and execute on key growth-enabling opportunities in concert with our Product Group Leads</li>
<li>Serve as a thought leader for Coinbase on white space business, product, and non-product opportunities for our partner teams</li>
<li>Act as connective tissue between the Platform org and key partners across the business</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BA / BS degree or equivalent practical experience (MBA a plus)</li>

<li>Outstanding executive-level verbal and written communication skills</li>

<p>Xapo Bank is the first product of its kind: a platform that bridges the gap between crypto and traditional banking services.

<p><strong><em>About us</em></strong></p>
<p>Xapo Bank is the first product of its kind: a platform that bridges the gap between crypto and traditional banking services. Headquartered in Gibraltar, we are regulated and authorised as a credit institution to provide fiat related services and in addition, Xapo VASP is regulated and authorised as a Distributed Ledger Technology Provider to provide crypto services. We offer secure, seamless access to US Dollar and Bitcoin, all accessible from our mobile based Xapo Banking App. Xapo holds one of the largest Bitcoin reserves in the world and liquid assets, all of which provide an additional layer of protection to our members. </p>
<p>Our beginning: A world that enjoys economic freedom and wealth protection, no matter where you live or who is running your country. This is the dream that drove Wences Casares, our Founder and Chairman, to quietly transform the world of private banking.</p>
<p>Growing up in Argentina in the 1980s, Wences saw his family’s life savings wiped out three times by events beyond their control. This inability to control or protect their own finances left a lasting legacy. Years later, when Bitcoin came along, Wences saw an extraordinary opportunity to create a fairer, and totally secure system that would allow ambitious individuals to truly realise their potential.</p>

<p>We are building a decentralized protocol that connects these market data providers to DeFi applications. It’s a market that connects these two types of participants, with various incentives to encourage participation on both sides.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that building a decentralized protocol requires lots of web development! Our most prominent website is <a href=""http://pyth.network"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">pyth.network</a> which shows off our price feeds, but there’s more. We need a website that allows end-users to interact with the protocol, a website for developer documentation, and various dashboards and monitoring tools. These websites are the public face of our protocol, and they’re absolutely essential to our success.</p>
<p>We’re looking for frontend engineers who can help us build and maintain these various websites. The primary focus of this job is frontend development; however, since we are a small team, the job will require pitching in on other tasks (such as backend development) to unblock the frontend work. Good candidates will have a strong sense of design and demonstrated experience building attractive, usable web properties. </p>
<p><strong>About Us and the Job</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are a small team. About half the team is technical; the other half manages relationships with data providers, developers, and the broader community. (Building a network requires talking to people!)</li>
<li>We are mostly remote. Team members live across the world, in the US, Europe, and Asia. We do have offices in some locations (Porto, Chicago, London, Amsterdam, Singapore) for those who prefer in-office work.</li>
<li>Our team communicates with each other and external developers in English. Strong spoken and written English skills are required.</li>
<li>We operate like a startup in the rapidly-growing and changing DeFi ecosystem. In order to be successful, we must adapt to meet the current needs of the market. Good candidates will help our organization adapt; they are flexible problem solvers who are willing and able to jump on whatever the occasion demands.</li>
<li>Most of our software development is open source. You can look at our <a href=""https://github.com/pyth-network/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">github repositories</a> to understand what we typically work on.</li>
<li>We offer a competitive salary and generous benefits package. Furthermore, where applicable, employees may be eligible for token allocations as part of Pyth Network’s employee incentive program.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You'll Do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design, build and maintain frontend applications for Pyth Network, including the <a href=""http://pyth.network"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">pyth.network</a> website and internal-facing tools.</li>
<li>Work with designers to develop a distinctive look and feel for Pyth Network web properties.</li>
<li>Ensure that Pyth Network websites are usable, responsive and accessible.</li>
<li>Assist with backend development as necessary to power frontend applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills You'll Need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strong software engineering skills. Blockchain or web3 experience is not required; we expect that engineers will be able to learn these skills on the job.</li>
<li>Strong design sense, as demonstrated by a record of building attractive and usable websites.</li>
<li>Ability to work in a startup-like fast-paced environment to meet the demands of a rapidly-changing market.</li>
<li>Familiarity with Typescript, React, and Python.</li>
<li>Ability to handle periodic on-call duties.</li>

<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>The Eco onboarding process is unique because it leverages the best from fintech companies and traditional banks. It aims to be fast and simple like fintechs (virtual self-onboarding) but makes space for in-depth conversations between new users and our team to build trust early like traditional banks (1-1 virtual onboarding with a specialist).As a growth product manager, you will be the product owner of the entire onboarding funnel. Your mission will be to drive user acquisition and initial product adoption (e.g. deposit, payroll, debit card, gift card, bill pay, …). To succeed in this role you will need to deeply understand our users and study their behavior by leveraging data and establishing hypotheses. Then, set up experiments to test your hypotheses, measure the outcomes and continue to creatively iterate. </p>
<p>In this cross-functional role, you will get the opportunity to utilize your stellar communication skills to partner with our onboarding, marketing, communications, support and education teams to identify, prioritize and drive key areas of opportunity to ‘unbank’ the masses.. As we continue to grow our user base you will have a massive impact on our internal teams and users in an inclusive and driven environment so you feel excited as we continue to quickly scale our user base.</p>
<p><strong>As as Growth Product Manager, you get to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build a growth strategy plan to acquire new customers by defining the target market, identifying personas, and aligning them to the most efficient acquisition channels. </li>
<li>Regularly analyze the key product growth metrics of your product and optimize the growth strategy accordingly.</li>
<li>Identify opportunities and develop perspectives on the most impactful growth features we should be building for our customers and our business.</li>
<li>Drive the strategy, tactics, and delivery timelines for growth funnel/features in mobile and web apps.</li>
<li>Lead cross-functional groups (engineering, design, legal, compliance, support, operations) to get initiatives across the line.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’re looking for you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have 3+ years of product management experience with a focus on growth</li>
<li>Have a track record of shipping B2C apps or web features successfully</li>
<li>Have engaged in the entire lifecycle of a product </li>
<li>Have experience creating data-informed hypotheses that will power experiment design and findings</li>

This role requires strong software engineering and communication skills — our users should feel like you’re one of their team members.

<li>We offer a competitive salary and generous benefits package. Furthermore, where applicable, employees may be eligible for token allocations as part of Pyth Network’s employee incentive program.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work directly with the community of Pyth Network developers to increase adoption. Understand developers’ problems and build solutions that reduce the cost of adoption and improve the developer experience.</li>
<li>Answer technical questions and synthesize insights that can inform product strategy.</li>
<li>Improve and create technical content — documentation, explainers, examples — to support developers, integrators, and business partners. Publish this content on Github and other channels to make integration of our oracle intuitive and easy.</li>
<li>Facilitate great onboarding experiences for developers and partners.</li>
<li>Build relationships with crypto protocols and find mutually beneficial business opportunities.</li>

<p>Operating Pyth Network is a nontrivial challenge. Our price feeds run 24x7. DeFi applications depend on the accuracy and availability of these feeds; an inaccurate price or offline feed can cause serious financial losses. Each feed in turn depends on many different services, some of which are run by our data providers and some by us. It’s a complex system with many different failure modes, but it has to work correctly all the time.</p>
<p>We also run a variety of off-chain services, such as the backend for the <a href=""http://pyth.network"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">pyth.network</a> website, and tools for logging historical data. These services run in a Kubernetes cluster that is managed using Terraform. We also need to ensure these services are running and healthy at all times.</p>
<p>We’re looking for people to help us operate this system and improve its reliability over time. This job has many different aspects, including providing front-line support for incidents, developing automation to manage our infrastructure, and defining deployment plans for high availability.</p>
<p><strong>About us and the Job</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are a small team. About half the team is technical; the other half manages relationships with data providers, developers, and the broader community. (Building a network requires talking to people!)</li>
<li>We are mostly remote. Team members live across the world, in the US, Europe, and Asia. We do have offices in some locations (Porto, Chicago, London, Amsterdam, Singapore) for those who prefer in-office work.</li>
<li>Our team communicates with each other and external developers in English. Strong spoken and written English skills are required.</li>
<li>We operate like a startup in the rapidly-growing and changing DeFi ecosystem. In order to be successful, we must adapt to meet the current needs of the market. Good candidates will help our organization adapt; they are flexible problem solvers who are willing and able to jump on whatever the occasion demands.</li>
<li>Most of our software development is open source. You can look at our <a href=""https://github.com/pyth-network/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc"" target=""_blank"">github repositories</a> to understand what we typically work on.</li>
<li>We offer a competitive salary and generous benefits package. Furthermore, where applicable, employees may be eligible for token allocations as part of Pyth Network’s employee incentive program.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You'll Do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide front-line response to incidents and outages, such as unavailable price feeds, or website downtime.</li>
<li>Develop automation tools to provision and manage our infrastructure, including cloud services and Kubernetes clusters. We currently use Terraform to manage our infrastructure, but we’re not married to it and may use different tools in the future. Some of our tools are written in Python and others in Go.</li>
<li>Design and implement operational plans to achieve high availability guarantees for our price feeds and web services. Build redundant service deployments, monitoring solutions, dashboards, and alerting tools to ensure that critical services are running continuously. Support services on development and production environments, from before launch through launch. Benchmark application resource consumption to allocate capacity.</li>
<li>Measure and monitor application metrics (availability, latency, etc.) to understand the health of the system. Work with developers to add metrics and logging to their applications in order to facilitate Grafana dashboards and alerts. Develop logging practices and libraries to standardize metric reporting and alerting across multiple programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills You'll Need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable developing software. Writing software is a big part of the job, as we write lots of tools to automate processes and monitor deployments.</li>
<li>Solid understanding of Linux fundamentals, such as processes and permissions, along with an understanding of containers (Docker) and cloud deployments.</li>
<li>Experience troubleshooting, monitoring and debugging cloud-native applications and distributed systems.</li>
<li>Ability to handle shared operational and periodic on-call duties</li>
<li>1+ years of experience supporting critical production environments. Work in financial and crypto markets is a plus.</li>
<li>Predictable and reliable availability. </li>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>If Immunefi is Web3’s last line of defense against catastrophic hacks, the Triage team at Immunefi is the internal intelligence division actively confirming and improving the defense strategy. The Web &amp; App triager role requires timely, appropriate, and thorough response to reported vulnerabilities. We want to bring on a member of the team that provides great service at the high end — if hackers are to trust submitting their critical findings to us, we need to be able to live up to their trust with timely and appropriate responses. Our evaluation of their bugs from a technical perspective is crucial to our ability to properly reward their hard work. At the low end we still need to provide great service--we want to help them grow their capabilities so that a bad bug report today turns into a great one in the future.</p>

<p>Role Responsibilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Review incoming Web &amp; Application vulnerability reports and reproduce issues, assessing the severity and impact of each issue within the context of each Projects (Clients) threat model</li>
<li>Work with Whitehats (Hackers) to identify missing information in reports, as well as help educate the community when reports are incorrect</li>
<li>Write a brief summary for each report, including clear reproduction steps, the impact of the issue, and remediation advice</li>
<li>Coordinate with our Bug Bounty Program team and customers to ensure smooth triage workflows for any programs you work with</li>
<li>Liaise across &amp; advocate for parties on both sides of the Bug Bounty (Projects &amp; Whitehats), providing advice, support &amp; technical consultation to ensure accuracy of information, fairness of outcome &amp; engagement of users</li>
<li>Proactively identify and solve issues, as well as accept and quickly respond to delegated work</li>
</ul>

<p>Applicant Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>You can write top-quality code samples and mini applications to demonstrate the technologies you want to explain</li>
<li>Familiarity with vulnerability disclosure and bounty programs, including: report formatting and content, confidentiality and disclosure processes, the importance of clear and quick communication between hackers and customers, program policies, etc.</li>
<li>Ability to prioritize and organize operationally complex work, with great attention to detail</li>
<li>Top notch communication skills: need to be able to firmly, yet politely, respond to non-issues, as well as identify legitimate issues and communicate them to security teams in an easy to understand format</li>
<li>Technical knowledge around Web3 security: ability to identify and reproduce reported vulnerabilities, as well as assess contextual risk</li>
<li>Being a fully remote company, we are willing to consider applicants in any area however due to the needs of our current Projects &amp; Whitehats, we require someone taking this role to have a work schedule aligned to Central / Western European Timezones </li>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Remote, ideally not more than +/-7 hours from CET</p>
<p>As stewards of the Polkadot ecosystem, Parity is laying the foundation for a better web which respects the freedom and data of individuals and empowers developers to create better services through decentralized technology. The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies. </p>
<p>Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralized and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organization and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.</p>
<h3><strong>About the position:</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking for an experienced, strategic leader to build and manage organic global social media and influencer relations for Polkadot, Kusama, and the Web3 Foundation, leveraging both established and emerging platforms. With an already strong and active following, you will develop ambitious plans and strategies that place Polkadot at the center of the conversation about building a better web. Your assignment is to evolve the Polkadot social brand by illustrating the Web3 vision, becoming a magnetic force and fueling a movement for change, and attracting people from both in and outside the blockchain world. Polkadot is built for unbounded innovation, and as such, this is an opportunity to break the mold and be creative in your approach.</p>
<p>You will have a track record of building impactful social media campaigns, strong creative writing skills, and understand how to get the most out of social channels to build brands. You will also have either direct crypto experience and/or genuine passion and enthusiasm for Web3 and blockchain technology. An ability to collaborate and work and cross-functionally will be key to success. </p>
<p>Reporting to the VP of Communications, this entrepreneurial role is core to the foundation of the Communications team and our mission to cultivate community, communicate our purpose, and elevate our brand.</p>

<h3><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Develop, lead and execute innovative social and influencer programs to drive engagement and further build the Polkadot community and vision for a better web </li>
<li>Build a world class “always on” social media function and team with a global finger on the pulse of social channels, both established and emerging.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Own the creation and execution of an influencer marketing program including original content creation, influencer management, planning and execution</li>

</li>
<li>A comprehensive social media leader that acts with autonomy and enthusiasm to strategize, create, build a community, and manage a team</li>
<li>Ability to identify and capitalize on trends, people, and conversations to drive conversations and content/storytelling opportunities in a fast-paced and often ambiguous environment</li>
<li>A deep understanding of crypto/blockchain social and its unique memes and lingo </li>
<li>Experiencing tracking social metrics around sentiment and reach to quantify the value of all social &amp; influencer efforts to the Polkadot community</li>
<li>A mindset that lends to taking risks, finding the edge, and questioning the status quo</li>
<li>

<p><strong>Director of Communications - The Americas</strong></p>

<p><strong>Location: </strong>Remote, anywhere in the United States</p>
<p>As stewards of the Polkadot ecosystem, Parity is laying the foundation for a better web which respects the freedom and data of individuals and empowers developers to create better services through decentralized technology. The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies. </p>
<p>Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralized and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organization and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>About the position:</strong></p>
<p>This is a greenfield opportunity for an experienced communications leader to have a critical impact on the growth of a rapidly scaling ecosystem and evolution of Polkadot. </p>
<p>As Director of Communications for the Americas, you will develop ambitious plans and strategies that place Polkadot at the center of the media conversation about building a better web across North and South America. Your assignment is to evolve the Polkadot narrative by illustrating the Web3 vision, becoming a magnetic force and fueling a movement for change, and attracting people both from in and outside the blockchain world. This requires engaging and inspiring a wide range of audiences including consumers, enterprise/business leaders, innovators, entrepreneurs, investors, and developers. Polkadot is built for unbounded innovation, and as such, this is an opportunity to break the mold and be creative in your approach.</p>
<p>You will have a proven track record in building holistic public relations strategies and highly impactful tactical execution. An established network across key media outlets and tech/crypto journalists – particularly the U.S. – will also be key.</p>
<p>Reporting to the VP of Communications, this entrepreneurial role is core to the foundation of the growing Communications team and our mission to cultivate the Web3 community, communicate our purpose, and elevate our brand.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plan, develop, and direct public relations and communication strategies to position and promote Polkadot throughout the Americas; focusing on steady placement of news stories across blockchain, crypto, tech, and business media.</li>
<li>Partner with Parity executives and Polkadot ecosystem stakeholders to build their profiles, develop key messages, and identify top opportunities for engagement with media and at industry events.</li>
<li>Oversee external public relations agencies ensuring consistent results, reporting, and accountability.</li>
<li>Monitor public narrative and sentiment around Polkadot, Kusama, the Web3 Foundation and other key brands; proposing strategy adjustments and initiatives where relevant, and continually recalibrating and enhancing both strategy and tactics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Serve as a source of knowledge and direction on the industry relationships, trends, and conditions that could impact our communication efforts.</li>
<li>Collaborate with on-chain governance-related initiatives, providing assistance and guidance where needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10+ years’ experience in public relations and/or communications roles, ideally in software and technology spaces. Web3/crypto experience a bonus. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Existing relationships with members of the media who cover our industry in the US, and excellent skills in building relationships with new external stakeholders.</li>
<li>Proven impact in enabling a tech innovator to punch above its weight in terms of media coverage and speaking opportunities, and successfully establishing an organization as a ‘go to’ expert visionary in emerging tech.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A self-starter who enjoys working in a fast-paced, evolving, sometimes ambiguous, and always open environment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An ability to project manage and lead cross-functional partners including social media, design, marketing, business development, and finance.</li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written language skills; fluency in English; proven experience as a senior spokesperson.</li>
<li>Either direct crypto experience and/or genuine passion and enthusiasm for Web3 and blockchain technology.</li>
<li>A mindset that lends to taking risks, finding the edge, and questioning the status quo</li>
<li>A belief that work can and should be fun</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>About working for us:</strong></h3>
<h3>For everyone who joins us:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competitive remuneration packages, including tokens (where legally possible), based on iterative market research</li>
<li>Remote-first, global working environment with flexible hours</li>
<li>Collaborative, fast-paced, and self-initiating culture, designed to mimic an open source workflow</li>
<li>Energizing and collaborative team and company retreats all over the world</li>
<li>Opportunity to learn more about Web3 while on the job, with access to some of the brightest minds in this space; we have plenty of educational initiatives such as internal sessions, all-hands, AMAs, hackathons, etc.</li>
<li>Teammates who are genuinely excited about their job, impact, and Parity’s mission</li>

<p>Eco puts your money back to work for you — creating the first consumer fintech product whose creators are aligned with its users. Financial infrastructure hasn't changed since the 1970s. All we've gotten are shinier products built on the same broken systems.</p>
<p>The Eco App changes that, starting by building the best place to save and spend your dollars. We combine high-yield savings with rewarded spending in a single, compounding balance that's easy to manage. Soon we'll let you pay your bills and put your financial life on autopilot. And through all of this — unlike every other fintech company — we don't skim from you.</p>
<p>That's only possible because we're working to introduce the Eco Currency, a new money built for real people. We believe that cryptocurrencies can fundamentally upgrade traditional money — but that won't happen without widespread distribution and a path to adoption. The Eco App is the first product to provide such a path, beginning with a familiar interface built for US Dollars and slowly building trust as we educate users on the benefits of this new paradigm.</p>
<p>Every day, we're working on difficult and impactful problems which demand solutions at the intersection of technology, product, marketing, and advocacy. To achieve our mission and realize our vision, we’ve put together an incredible team and are selectively adding to it. We hope you’ll consider joining us.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><strong>As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience working collaboratively on a cross-functional team.</li>
<li>Integrate partner APIs into our backend system to grow the range of financial products and services Eco offers.</li>
<li>Write code to create and maintain APIs that deliver consistent abstractions to empower our frontend developers.</li>
<li>Monitor and support the ongoing operation of our backend servers.</li>
<li>Participate in all product development phases from requirements to production.</li>
<li>Champion for a remarkable user experience by supporting our user support team in debugging user-facing issues and delivering solutions  (a responsibility we take very seriously, and share teamwide).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’re looking for you if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have 5+ years of backend engineering experience, preferably with a consumer facing fintech product.</li>
<li>You develop with a focus on testability or for the purpose of performing automated tests.</li>
<li>You possess a strong understanding of security and privacy. Preserving user trust is a high priority for you.</li>
<li>You have proven a strong aptitude for learning new technologies with a good instinct for discovering defects.</li>
<li>You learn fast, are collaborative by default, and have outstanding communication skills (especially written).</li>
<li>Bonus points if you already already have: experience with NestJS, GraphQL, Docker, and Continuous Integration tools; knowledge of payment technology, fintech, and/or crypto.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>About Protocol Labs</strong></h4>
<p>Protocol Labs is a research and development laboratory that has built and scaled multiple projects that have made great contributions to the web3 ecosystem. To fuel our next phase of growth, we’ve created a new team — Network Services — to provide services and capabilities that our projects and the broader ecosystem can leverage, including design, video, events, operations, content, IT, and more. </p>
<h4><strong>About the Protocol Labs Network</strong></h4>
<p>The Protocol Labs Network (PLN) is a community of open-source teams, projects, and organizations focused on researching, developing, and deploying network protocols to improve humanity’s most influential technology, the Internet.

<p>As stewards of the Polkadot and Substrate ecosystem, Parity is laying the foundation for a better web which respects the freedom and data of individuals and empowers developers to create better services through decentralised technology. The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies. </p>
<p>Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralised and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organisation and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.</p>

<h3>About the team:</h3>
<p>As a Validator Research Analyst (VRA) and apprentice to our Master of Validators, you will help Parity’s collaborators in the Web 3 ecosystem build the future of Polkadot by supporting infrastructure partners, application builders, chain builders, and end users.</p>

<p>A VRA will contribute value to the ecosystem by helping decentralize the network further with various infrastructure, governance, and community initiatives. Some days this means reviewing treasury proposals or designing new feature sets of existing external products, other days this means contributing code to core microservices. A VRA works together with the community of builders, enabling them to produce shared value.</p>

<li>Coordinating ecosystem builders in designing products and features that bring shared value to the ecosystem</li>
<li>Enabling parachain builders in launching their networks.</li>
<li>Maintaining relationships with partners and supporting them long-term.</li>
<li>Contributing full-stack engineering to systems of microservices that power critical products and services in the ecosystem</li>
<li>Cultivating community led projects via decentralized governance systems.</li>
<li>Contributing to documentation to ensure that our resources answers common questions and stays up to date.</li>
<li>Collecting and communicating feedback to inform product development.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About you:</h3>
<p>This role is a ‘generalist’ style role, we aren’t looking for someone with all of these skills, we’re looking for someone who is fundamentally smart, has a genuine and demonstrable interest in Polkadot, decentralisation and working with a like minded community to work towards creating a truly decentralised Polkadot. However we are looking for at least some of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep knowledge of how Polkadot works at a protocol level, including consensus, storage, and various key system pallets</li>
<li>Exceptional knowledge of Linux, including security aspects, networking and virtualization (3 years min)</li>
<li>Experience with containerization including Docker and Kubernetes</li>
<li>Infrastructure as code mindset: Experience with configuration management (e.g. Ansible) and cloud orchestration (e.g. Terraform)</li>
<li>Values monitoring and observability, with metrics being a guiding factor towards implemenations and operations</li>
<li>Has worked in Cloud Native (GCP, AWS, Azure, etc) environments before.</li>
<li>Knowledge of and interest in decentralized technologies.</li>
<li>Experience in Typescript (Rust is also a nice plus)</li>
<li>Ability to communicate complex technical information in a clear, precise, and concise manner to a wide range of key stakeholders</li>
<li>Ability to communicate and function in a distributed team.</li>
</ul>

In summary, some of what you'll do:</p>
<p>- Document and drive the roadmap(s) in a supportive manner, prioritising tasks and managing the team's resources, and identifying resource constraints and any other issues that arise</p>

<p>- Excellent interpersonal, verbal, and written communication skillset</p>
<p>- A demonstrated ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously and schema to balance competing priorities when needed</p>
<p>- Ability to influence internal collaborators without direct management responsibility</p>
<p>- (ideally) Knowledge of the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem and network</p>

<p><em>Note to applicants: we have offices located in Berlin, Lisbon, and London, but Parity has teammates distributed across the EU and beyond. We are a remote-first organization, and for this team, ideally, you’ll be in a timezone within a couple of hours of UTC+0.</em></p>

<p>As stewards of the Polkadot and Substrate ecosystem, Parity is laying the foundation for a better web that respects the freedom and data of individuals and empowers developers to create better services through decentralized technology. The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies. </p>
<p>Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralized and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organization and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.</p>

<p>We primarily write our tooling in Rust, with some parts in JavaScript/TypeScript. </p>

<p>Product Marketing Manager - Competitive Intelligence</p>
<p>As stewards of the Polkadot and Substrate ecosystem, Parity is laying the foundation for a better web which respects the freedom and data of individuals and empowers developers to create better services through decentralised technology. The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies. </p>
<p>Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralised and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organisation and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.</p>
<h3>About the team:</h3>
<p>Within Parity’s Marketing Communications department the Product Marketing team is growing rapidly.  We bring the value of the developer experience, DOT token, protocol and governance, and the ever-expanding ecosystem of parachain teams and dApps to the market.

<li>Create a company-wide understanding of competitors through the timely and relevant communication of competitive announcements, insights, tools, and collateral</li>
<li>Work with Ecosystem Development, Marketing, and Engineering teams on competitive analysis for messaging, positioning, and strategy</li>
<li>Establish methods and processes to ensure ongoing competitive information flow to stakeholders across the organisation and the Polkadot ecosystem</li>
<li>Measure the level of engagement and meaningful use of competitive content</li>
</ul>
<h3>About you:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experience in analysing competitive landscapes and specific competitors</li>
<li>Experience with syndicating timely and relevant competitive content to internal stakeholders and an external ecosystem</li>
<li>Familiarity with Web3: You understand key Web3 concepts and are familiar with the main players in the space (Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, BSC, Polkadot, Cosmos, Polygon, to name a few). Experience in the Web3 space would be an advantage, but it is not a requirement</li>
<li>Ability to roll up your sleeves working with various constituents to develop detailed source content such as landscape and competitive reports, presentations, and enablement content</li>
<li>A high degree of accountability, coordination of programs and projects, and development of marketing solutions and tools collaborating with multiple departments</li>
<li>Data driven to measure, analyse and iterate and develop competitive analysis and tools based on key metrics and goals to ensure optimal performance</li>
<li>You will be reporting to the VP of Product Marketing</li>
</ul>
<h3>About working for us:</h3>

	<p>Über das Team &amp; die Position:</p>

	<p>Das Team interne IT besteht derzeit aus (mit Ihnen) 5 Personen: Leitung, zwei erfahrenen Administratoren und zwei Werkstudierenden. Ab Mitte des Jahres wird eine der Werkstudierenden-Stellen in eine weitere Administrator*innen-Stelle umgewandelt, für die Sie dann den Einstellungsprozess gestalten können. </p>

	<p>Die insgesamt derzeit 160 Mitarbeitenden (bald 170) brauchen eine stabile, datenschutzfreundliche IT-Infrastruktur. Die Basis unserer Infrastruktur bilden einerseits Ubuntu-Laptops und eine Reihe von uns selbst administrierter Dienste auf der Basis Freier Software (Nextcloud, Mattermost, Gitea u.a., sowie natürlich Mediawiki) und andererseits Google Workspace. </p>

	<p>Wir streben an, in Zukunft wieder unabhängiger von Google zu werden und suchen eine Person, die uns in dieser Richtung voranbringt. Hier geht es darum, mit Leidenschaft und Augenmaß dicke Bretter zu bohren und das richtige Maß zu finden zwischen unserem politischen Anspruch und der Notwendigkeit, Lösungen zu finden, die im praktischen Alltag funktionieren. </p>

	<p>Das bewirken Sie bei uns:</p>

    Sie sind verantwortlich für die Leitung des Teams Interne IT. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, gemeinsam mit Ihrem Team die IT-Strategie weiterzuentwickeln und umzusetzen. Sie arbeiten aktiv daran, dass Ihre Team-Mitglieder produktiv und erfolgreich arbeiten können.
    Sie übernehmen die Budgetverantwortung für die gesamte interne IT-Infrastruktur inkl. externer Dienstleistungen und hierzu eingekaufter IT-Dienstleistungen.

    Sie sind verantwortlich für die projektbezogene Kommunikation und sind die Ansprechperson für interne Anspruchsgruppen.
    Sie sind verantwortlich für Koordination, Controlling und Optimierung des First-Level-Support.

	<p>Freuen Sie sich auf:</p>

    Eine kollaborative Zusammenarbeit, geleitet durch unsere Werte: Beteiligung, Diversität, freier und offener Zugang, Gerechtigkeit, Nachhaltigkeit und respektvolle Zusammenarbeit
    Benefits: 30 Urlaubstage bzw. 25 Urlaubstage für Werkstudierende und zusätzlich arbeitsfrei am 24.12. und Silvester, ÖPNV-Ticket, Zuschuss zur beruflichen Altersvorsorge, Lohnfortzahlung im Betreuungsfall eines erkrankten Kindes
    Alle Überstunden werden erfasst und in Freizeitausgleich umgewandelt 
    Ein zentral gelegenes Büro und die Möglichkeit, teilweise mobil zu arbeiten
    Inhouse-Training und berufliche Weiterbildung sowie kostenfreies externes Lebenslagen-Coaching (professionelle Beratung und Coaching zu beruflichen und privaten Themen)

	<p>Das zeichnet Sie aus:</p>

    Sie besitzen mehrjährige Berufserfahrung im Bereich IT-Projektmanagement und IT-Service-Management.
    Sie besitzen sehr gute Erfahrung in der Führung von Mitarbeitenden.
    Sie sind versiert in der Steuerung von externen Dienstleistern.
    Sie besitzen Erfahrung im Umgang mit Datenschutz, inkl. <span class=""caps"">DSGVO</span>-Compliance.
    Sie besitzen detaillierte Kenntnisse im Bereich IT-Sicherheit.
    Sie sind vertraut mit Skriptsprachen.
    Sie sind vollständig arbeitsfähig auf Deutsch und Englisch (etwa äquivalent “C1”).
    Sie besitzen eine kommunikative, offene und teamfähige Persönlichkeit mit einem sicheren Auftreten und strukturierter Arbeitsweise.
    Sie bringen Offenheit gegenüber und Freude an Freien Software-Lösungen mit.

	<p>About the position &amp; the team:</p>

	<p>The Wikibase Suite is a software suite to collaboratively curate linked data that users can install on their infrastructure (also in the form of <span class=""caps"">OCI</span> container images). It is used by libraries, galleries, research groups, and the public sector alike. For example, the European Commission uses Wikibase for information around funded projects and their beneficiaries.</p>

	<p>You will be developing open source software that puts user needs first and increases users’ satisfaction. At Wikimedia Deutschland we work towards a future in which people share the power to collect and organize the data that shapes humanity&#8217;s understanding of the world.</p>

	<p>What you&#8217;ll be doing:</p>

    Participate in all the stages of software development as well as code, design, and architectural reviews providing constructive feedback
    Be responsible for and present in all stages of the engineering work:
    Be responsible for the technical direction of the team
    Understand and discuss mid- and long-term implications of architectural resolutions and be able to communicate the impact of engineering decisions on our products
    Maintain a good understanding of the technical aspects of the product roadmap as well as the team goals
    Work with managers and technical leads to ensure engineering effort is focused on the most impactful areas for their team
    Support the professional growth of other engineers together with engineering managers and technical leads
    Engage in constantly improving the team processes and agile practices

	<p>What we offer:</p>

    You will be part of a cohesive and engaged team that fosters unity and supports each other
    Flexible working hours adjusted to the team and people needs
    A diverse and inclusive bi-lingual organisation where people are the first priority
    An open-minded and positive organizational culture
    Work in cross-functional teams towards a common goal
    We dedicate one day per quarter in the department to work on any non-work-related project you want 
    Opportunity for personal and professional development
    Opportunity to improve your presentation skills and to share your favourite topics in internal presentations to the other engineering teams
    Opportunity to go to conferences, both as participants and contributors
    The possibility of working from home as well as a modern and centrally located office space in Berlin
    30 days of holidays, public transport allowance, access to complementary pension benefits, continued salary in the event of ill children, free-of-cost external life coaching
    All overtime is recorded and converted into compensatory time off
    This is a permanent contract

	<p>Learn more about our team by visiting our Wikimedia Tech News Blog. </p>

	<p>What makes you right for this role:</p>

    You are passionate and care about software
    Your background is not important as long as you have a solid understanding and experience with object oriented programming and experience with web development
    You have worked with <span class=""caps"">OCI</span> containers (e.g. Docker, Docker Compose)
    You like being in a team working towards a common goal, learning together, and supporting and lifting up your peers
    You have an eye for software design and quality and you understand the importance of tests
    You can recognize legacy code and know how to effectively deal with it
    You like to participate in technical discussions and are open to new ideas
    You are a fan of innovation and like to promote innovative approaches within the team
    You are not afraid of making mistakes and you learn from them
    You want to keep learning and developing yourself
    You are able to communicate in English at a professional capacity

	<p>Technologies we use:</p>

	<p>Most of our server side code is written in <span class=""caps"">PHP</span> and for version control we use Git. We use Vue.js and TypeScript for our modern frontends. We also keep migrating our legacy code into these and newer technologies. Also, testing is important to us; we use testing frameworks and practice continuous integration across our projects. We currently use Docker to provide Wikibase Suite to the users.</p>

	<p>Knowledge and experience in these technologies is not a requirement. We believe they all can be learned on the job and <span class=""caps"">WMDE</span>, your team, and your line manager will support you in this learning. We list only a few of them here. <br />
Interested?</p>

	<p>Then apply now! Send us your detailed application documents (Resume &amp; Motivational Letter (yes, we read them)) via our job portal. Our HR team will be happy to answer your questions. We kindly ask you to refrain from application photos and information on date of birth, marital status and parents. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

Associate Full Stack Developer,https://remoteOK.com/jobs/197082,2023-02-20T02:05:24+00:00,,"<p><strong>(Part-Time, Contract/Freelance)</strong></p><h2>About us</h2><p>Epsilamic Solutions is expanding its digital experience agency branch. As a technical and creative partner to small businesses and high-growth startups, we help our clients build delightful customer experiences and set up their internal technical processes for success.Â </p><p>Throughout the last few years, weâve worked with a diverse set of customers, from boutique hotels to startups founded by Y Combinator alumni.</p><p>We are a very lean team with a startup mentality and a laser focus on customer outcomes, getting things done and bringing out the best of each otherâs talents at work, while maintaining a positive, inclusive, and fun attitude in our work culture.</p><p>Epsilamic is a remote company, headquartered in Canada, with most of the work being done during EST/PST timezones. High autonomy, clear and friendly communication, and transparency are some of our most important core values, to make the most of async work in a distributed team.</p><h2>Our current technical stack</h2><ul><li>React, TypeScript, Next.js, Webpack+Babel build toolchain (non-CRA)</li><li>Python, Chalice (serverless framework), SQLAlchemy,Â </li><li>AWS, a lot of AWSÂ Lambda but we also have projects that involve Dockerized APIs<ul><li>understanding how IAM roles work will be very helpful on some projects</li><li>at this point,Â knowledge of lower-level AWS services (EC2, ECS, Lambda, API Gateway, S3) is much more important than any knowledge of Amplify, Beanstalk, etcÂ </li></ul></li><li>Postgres, DynamoDB</li><li>Contentful (headless CMS)</li></ul><p>Note that this is some of our currently most-frequently used technologies. All of this is subject to change very fast (and a lot of that change may very well end up being the influence of your futureÂ work with us!).</p><p>We understand that it's impractical to ask that our new teammates come in with the exact same tech stack as what we use. If you already have experience with this stack - that's amazing. If not - that's totally okay, butÂ we will ask you to pick up/study our tech stack and expect that you can get comfortable with it in a matter of a week or so.</p><h2>Our work culture</h2><ul><li>We are a startup</li><li>Remote-first, async work withÂ high autonomy</li><li>Regular teamÂ meetings over Zoom with video</li><li>We value our teammates' happiness over rigid process<br /></li><li>We welcome initiative, new ideas and collaborative decision making<ul><li>With that said, if we get stuck in committee-decision-making, we believe in aÂ Disagree-and-Commit approach</li></ul></li><li>We value courage to exploreÂ changes, pivots, and uncharted territories outside of our comfort zone</li><li>We challenge established status-quo of the worldÂ when we think we can make it better</li><li>We value ourÂ failures as a learning opportunity to help us grow</li><li>We value our successes as an opportunity to show gratitude towards each other, and to remember what worked well</li><li>We value long-term sustainable strategy over ""heroism"", all-nighters and burn-out. We'll be here for a very long time.</li></ul><h2>Who are we looking for?</h2><p>We are looking for a mid-level full-stack software developer, preferably with a slightly stronger emphasis on the front-end part of the stack, to join our team.Â </p><p>Responsibilities will include:</p><ul><li>Implementing the front-end for various projects, given UI designs/wireframes and technical guidelines</li><li>Improving our core UI technical platform by developing component libraries and documenting best practices</li><li>Implementing the back-end for some of our projects in collaboration with a senior staff member</li><li>Researching, recommending and helping our team adopt new tools, libraries and frameworks</li><li>Together with the technical lead, participating in meetings with customers to provide technical context to discussions and to refine timeline/effort estimations</li><li>Participating in regular stand-ups, sprint planning meetings with the team, as well as being available for collaborative Zoom work sessions (with reasonable notice - we're still mostly async).</li></ul><p>This role is currentlyÂ <strong>part-time (20h / week)</strong>Â with a possibility of being extended to full-time in the long-term future, based on the performance of both of the candidate and the company. Ideally, we are looking for a motivated technologist, who would be interested in growing together with the team over a long period of time. Depending on future company performance, there may also be a great opportunity for a more involved senior leadership role.Â </p><p><strong>Please note that this position is currently aimed at independent contractors/freelancers only - this is not employment (at least, for now).</strong><strong>Â </strong></p><p><strong>Please also note that due to some slight confusion regarding RemoteOK's guidelines, the annual salary maximum specified on this job posting is the ""full-time equivalent"" (i.e. what we'd be paying if we were hiring on a full-time basis). The annual salary minimum is what we'd be paying for part-time (half of the full-time equivalent).Â </strong>While it is possible that we may offer a conversion to full-time in the future, we are currently hiring for part-time only (i.e. you'd get $30-35K a year, and you'd work ~20h/week).</p><h2>Detailed requirements</h2><p>On the technical side, youâd be a great fit if youâre comfortable with the following:</p><p><strong>Frontend</strong></p><ul><li>A solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals in the context of modern web applications</li><li>At least 2-5 years of experience with React (preferred), Vue, Angular or a similar component framework</li><li>Experience working with CSS-in-JS frameworks like styled-components, and/or frameworks like Tailwind.</li><li>High-level understanding of modern front-end build tools (e.g. Webpack, Vite, or equivalent).</li><li>Excellent knowledge of HTML, CSS and CSS extensions and preprocessors like Sass, PostCSS, etc</li><li>Demonstrated attention to detail when integrating UI components, with an emphasis on visual consistency and usability.

We wonât ask you to be an expert in distributed systems, however basic awareness of different architecture patterns at a high level is required.</li><li>At least 2-5 years of experience with Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java or another language in the context of developing APIs (REST or GraphQL).</li><li>Excellent understanding of SQL in the context of any popular relational database (Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL, or another database), as well as awareness of how to retrieve query plans and explore basic performance optimizations.</li><li>Solid understanding of at least one NoSQL database (any document, key-value or column stores are good - e.g.Â Â DynamoDB/MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, or equivalent), with a basic understanding of architectural and performance implications of their use</li></ul><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p><ul><li>Experience deploying low to medium-complexity applications on VMs or containers in at least one of popular cloud environment (AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure, GCP or any on-prem infrastructure management frameworks like OpenStack, etc).</li><li>Understanding of CI/CD from a userâs perspective and experience working in projects that use Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions or anything similar.</li><li>Solid understanding of containerization basics (Docker, lxc, or anything similar)</li><li>Solid understanding of basic networking (OSI protocol stack and where HTTP and TLS fit in, TCP vs UDP, basic DNS architecture)</li><li>Solid understanding of both client-side and server-side caching from a developerâs point of view.Â </li></ul><p><strong>Fundamental technical skills</strong></p><ul><li>Ability to work without advanced AI-assisted tooling such as GitHub Copilot (donât worry, though - regular Googling/researching StackOverflow/etc is a must for our profession, and we won't ask you to memorize arbitrary APIs as part of your work).<br /></li><li>Excellent understanding and a responsible, proactive attitude towards information security from a developerâs point view, including securing password and access token, being able to use 2FA to access company resources, awareness of open-source software supply chain security issues in everyday work and common-sense security precautions.</li><li>Knowledge of unit, integration and end-to-end testing patterns, and practical experience designing and writing tests in any framework on both the front end and the back end.</li><li>Solid understanding of using shell scripts for everyday tasks (bash, zsh, or any other shell)</li><li>Basic knowledge of Git and ability to work efficiently under different branching models</li><li>Bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field is preferred. However, if you have a unique set of circumstances that you believe gives you an equivalent level of experience, we will be happy to talk to you, hear your story and consider you application based on its objective merits.</li></ul><p><strong>TeamworkÂ </strong></p><ul><li>Excellent/fluent written and verbal communication skills in English</li><li>Visual presentability and a highly professional attitudeÂ at all times during customer meetings.

</p>

<div>👋 Thanks for stopping by and learning more about this role at Sitemate! ✨🏗️</div><div><br></div><div>We’d love to hear from you 🙂 👩‍💻👩🏽‍💻🧑🏿‍💻👨🏻‍💻</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Brief overview of this role at Sitemate:</strong></div><ul>
<li>We are looking for a senior level mobile / full stack software engineer to join our engineering team and lead our two React Native mobile projects.</li>
<li>This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy around your work on mobile projects. Maybe you are working in a bigger team and don’t have any opportunities to take a lead role. Maybe you’ve worked in startups or had your own startup that has finished up, and you want to join a startup team that move quickly and place a huge emphasis on product and engineering.</li>
<li>You will have opportunities such as becoming a foundational member of our engineering team, regardless of your location. You will have the opportunity to pull responsibility and technical ownership off of our CTO’s ‘plate’, and make it your own area of expertise. You will have the opportunity to learn (and improve) complex mobile-specific challenges such as sharing components between mobile applications, full offline mode, real-time syncing between mobile and web and native multimedia uploading. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our Head of Product, Head of Design &amp; UX and product-focused CEO.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Employment Type:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Full-time.</li>
<li>Preferred Based: Melbourne, Sydney, Remote Australia, America, Canada, Vancouver, Brazil, Asia (Philipines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia) *</li>
<li>Remuneration: AUD $130K-$220K</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Why should I consider joining Sitemate?</strong></div><ul>

</li>
<li>We have equal opportunity for applicants of all genders, ethnicity and sexualities - Sitemate's team is proudly diverse.</li>
<li>You will have flexible working options - our team is a blend of fully remote and hubs around offices. People based in hub cities typically work in the office 2-3 days per week, and 2-3 days working from home.</li>
<li>You will be remunerated based on your performance. If you are performing well, you won’t need to wait 3 years or have to find better offers elsewhere to receive an increase to your remuneration. 7 out of the last 10 remuneration increases for Sitemate team members have been made pro-actively by management, without the individual needing to even raise the topic of remuneration.</li>
<li>You will get a laptop and a budget to set up your home office (standing desk, monitor, headphones etc).</li>
<li>You will be able to attend company-sponsored training, workshops or conferences that help with your role.</li>
<li>You will get additional benefits and support as parents - with paid leave for both primary and secondary carers (includes adoption), as well as support and leave for the tragic circumstances of stillbirth.</li>
<li>You will get equity options and ownership in Sitemate on a standard vesting schedule. See here a general overview of how this works: <a href=""https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/"">https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/</a>
</li>
<li>Sitemate has grown from 5 people in 2018 to now over 40, and we’re now moving into the next stage of growing to 100 people! We have a product that customers are strongly engaged with, and every month we get around 300-400 new leads whilst spending $0 on marketing and 0 cold calling.</li>
<li>Sitemate’s founders have diverse backgrounds - one with coming from engineering on major infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges and tunnels, the second coming from product and graphic design. This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.</li>
<li>Sitemate graduated from Australia’s #1 Technology Company Accelerator - Startmate (complete coincidence on the names… 😅).</li>
<li>Sitemate has strong financial backing from Blackbird (Australia and NZ’s #1 Vc) and Shearwater Growth Capital (founded by two Directors of WiseTech - a $14B software company for the logistics industry).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What is the working environment like at Sitemate?</strong></div><ul>
<li>We are very transparent - monthly allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.</li>
<li>We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.</li>
<li>We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.</li>
<li>You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.</li>
<li>You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand - no worries. If you want to block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.</li>
<li>We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What does Sitemate do, exactly?</strong></div><ul>
<li>Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.</li>
<li>Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour due to covid-19, Generation Z starting to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.</li>
<li>See here an example wind farm project that is powered by Sitemate: <a href=""https://roadbridge.ie/projects/beinn-an-tuirc-windfarm-phase-3/"">https://roadbridge.ie/projects/beinn-an-tuirc-windfarm-phase-3/</a>

</li>
<li>Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.</li>

</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What will I be doing day to day in this role?</strong></div><ul>
<li>Take technical ownership of our two mobile products &amp; their backends - developing new features, fixing bugs, re-architecting core components functions.</li>
<li>Inheriting the technical vision for our mobile products from our CTO, improving it, and ensuring all work day to day is working towards this technical vision.</li>
<li>Working closely with our delivery team (product owner &amp; QA Engineers), product team and broader engineering team. As a senior engineer, you will be expected to coordinate the mobile projects and will be the point of contact for our CTO and CEO.</li>
<li>Assisting our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?</strong></div><ul>
<li>As you will be working directly with our CTO (a former founder) and our Founder/CEO, you will need to be able to manage communication, problem solving and your own technical execution/contributions.</li>
<li>You will need to be acutely aware of your own productivity and ensure that you are always driving towards outcomes that will impact users.</li>
<li>Our mobile products seem simple to our users, but contain a high degree of technical complexity - from shared components across multiple mobile apps, to backend services that only serve the mobile client - there will be a lot to learn.</li>
<li>We will be completely re-architecting our product’s hierarchy in the next 12 months from a rigid tree/folder structure to a flexible tree/folder structure, which will nearly certainly require refactoring every part of our product 🙃.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (Ideally most but not all)</strong></div><ul>
<li>Javascript/Typescript experience is preferred.</li>
<li>React Native experience is preferred.</li>
<li>Node, Serverless &amp; AWS experience a bonus.</li>
<li>MongoDB &amp; DynamoDB experience is a bonus.</li>
<li>Native mobile experience is a bonus (as per above, we are planning on forking a portion of our React Native app to enable the usage of native components for multimedia uploading).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>FAQs</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>What does the application and interview process look like? And how long does it take?</strong></div><div>Once you have expressed interest, we have an online application form that is connected to our internal systems. Following on from this, we have a combination of an online self service quiz and interviews. Usually it will only take a day or two to hear an update on next steps, and the overall process for those who make it all the way through, will usually take a couple of weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>*Note for remote candidates - Sitemate has a standardised COL (Cost of Living) multiplier that is applied to the remuneration bands shown, based on your location, it may go up or down.</div>

<div>At <a href=""https://www.podia.com/"">Podia</a>, we’re building the best creator platform on the planet. Our goal is to make the most <a href=""https://www.creatorfriendly.com/"">creator-friendly platform</a> to help people build their websites, run their communities, and sell their online courses and digital products.</div><div><br></div><div>Podia is a fully remote company, has helped creators earn hundreds of millions since 2014, and is adding thousands of new creators every week. </div><div><br></div><div>Because of the number of people we reach, we run an integrated approach to marketing that uses major announcements to build excitement, then channels that excitement to get eyes on things that contribute to the long-term success of our creators (like community, access to consultants, or content). We choose projects that directly tie to new business, churn, product activation, and other key components of our success. </div><div><br></div><div>And we want you to help. </div><div><br></div><div>Your job as Podia’s director of marketing will be to drive the core growth engine of the business.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not your typical marketing role. You won’t be trying to prove 5% improvements across 8 different channels. You won’t be pumping more and more money into ads to hit a monthly target. You won’t be churning out SEO content or gated ebooks. Instead, you’ll be hunting for Podia’s biggest growth opportunities, regardless of what channel they can be found in.</div><div><br></div><div>The right person for this role is a generalist and an ongoing student of marketing. You may have come up through content, product marketing, or growth, but your focus is on finding the bottlenecks of growth and tackling them with whatever tools you have at your disposal. </div><div><br></div><div>With that said, here are a few of the ongoing marketing practices you might get involved in:</div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Content</strong>. After shifting to a freemium model, Podia’s content focus has changed. With free accounts the key driver of top-of-funnel leads, there’s less pressure on content to generate leads and more opportunity to drive revenue with a targeted approach to content.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lifecycle/In-app</strong>. Podia has some lifecycle in place for free/paid users, inactive users, and people who take actions in the app — but there’s substantial opportunity to get more sophisticated.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community</strong>. Podia’s Creator Community has several thousand members and is more active than most SaaS communities. But the nature of the creator market means there’s still a ton of opportunity to grow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Affiliates/Partnerships</strong>. The affiliate program relaunched last year and has grown quickly. Partnerships with other creator companies have recently begun and are showing promise.</li>
<li>
<strong>Campaigns/Programs</strong>. Podia runs programs that are <em>just cool</em>. Our philosophy (more on this below) is to use big moments to get the attention that leads to long-term systemic improvements — and that means you’ll have a ton of freedom to come up with creative campaigns that lead to more impact than the sum of their parts. </li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>It’s a big role and you’ll wear a lot of hats, but it’s also a role with basically unlimited opportunity to affect the growth trajectory of an already growing company. You’ll start with a small team, and work with the VP of marketing, the marketing team, and the rest of the company to make things that matter to creators. </div><div><br></div><div>If you’re still interested, let’s dive in.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Why this is a dream marketing opportunity</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Podia has been growing organically for the last six years, and in June 2022 switched from a free trial to a freemium business model. </div><div><br></div><div>Since June, we’ve added tens of thousands of creators and continued to invest in freemium. We’re growing, but there are opportunities to grow faster and better, and you could be part of making it possible for anyone to become an online creator. </div><div><br></div><div>From a marketing perspective, Podia has grown through a few key channels:</div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Content. </strong>Content marketing was the first major investment Podia made, and there’s a strong base of traffic to Podia’s site as well as a YouTube channel with over 25,000 subscribers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Affiliates.</strong> Podia affiliates drive people to Podia’s free plan, and a recently revamped affiliate program has been scaling quickly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Word of mouth.</strong> Creators talk to each other a <em>lot</em>. A combination of feeding word of mouth (via our overall approach to marketing) and revamping our pricing/packaging to make Podia more accessible has led to rapid growth. </li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>Recently, Podia has been investing in integrated campaigns that launch major programs. In 2023, Podia is awarding creator fellowships every month of the year — and application to those fellowships is part of how we drive our users to our other work (like the multi-thousand person creator community, a user-generated advice library, customer research surveys, or Podia-created courses about how to succeed as a creator). </div><div><br></div><div>Part of our marketing philosophy is that we use big moments to improve the performance of systems. Actually, here. Just take a look at all four principles of our marketing:</div><div><br></div><ol>
<li>Build systems that target our core growth model and gather steam over time</li>
<li>Use big moments to improve the performance of systems</li>
<li>Go for high upside</li>
<li>Get attention without fighting for attention</li>
</ol><div><br></div><div>All of this is to say — you will have major marketing moments to build excitement for your campaigns. Your team’s work will be seen by hundreds of thousands of creators. You’ll have opportunities to work on unorthodox, outside-the-box campaigns, and creativity is strongly rewarded. Podia values quality, and you’ll have the opportunity to do incredible work.  </div><div><br></div><div>It’s also to say — this isn’t your typical marketing role. All the marketing we do is integrated (no silos). You won’t be creating a content mill that churns out SEO content. You won’t put together campaign assets and then just hand it off to another team (or let them sit unpromoted on a website). You won’t have channel-by-channel “strategies” — it will be your job to work with the VP of marketing and determine your team’s contribution to the business’ <em>overall</em> growth strategy.  </div><div><br></div><div>For the right person, this could be a dream job. You’ll have a ton of creative freedom and you’ll work on things that are just straight up cool. </div><div><br></div><div>At the same time, the role isn’t for everyone. Marketing at Podia isn’t a service organization, and there’s no paint-by-numbers. There are no traffic targets, SEO (outside of targeted opportunities) isn’t the top priority, we aren’t putting a bunch of money into ad spend, and you’ll spend just as much time working on integrated marketing campaigns as you do on individual channels. This also isn’t a purely managerial role — the person who succeeds in this position will blend management, coaching, and getting things done.</div><div><br></div><div>As a company, we value running towards the most important problems over solving the problem that happens to match the tool we have in our hands right now. We like to think all this is a bit unusual, and that also means you won’t be limited by some of the usual blockers:</div><div><br></div><div><em>If you’ve ever been asked to do marketing for a product that isn’t very good, or is in a “nice to have” market, you know how hard it is to watch customers slip away for yet another month of flat growth.</em></div><div><br></div><div>At Podia, our NPS is in the 99th percentile for internet companies. Our customers love us, we’ve helped many of them become successful, and your hard work won’t go to waste. </div><div><br></div><div>The creator market isn’t going anywhere. More and more people keep joining the creator economy, and Podia is there to tap into the demand. Creators <em>need</em> a platform to run their business, and that’s what we give them — a must-have product in a high-growth market. </div><div><br></div><div><em>If you’ve been stuck marketing a “boring” (or worse) product, you know how hard it is to wake up and fake enthusiasm about what you’re selling.</em></div><div><br></div><div>Podia gets emails from creators every day. Every single day there's a creator using Podia to earn their first dollar online. You’ll never doubt that your work matters, because every day you’ll see more creators sharing how much they love Podia. </div><div><br></div><div>We have customers all over the world — people who are starting side hustles or starting business or quitting jobs because of the income they make from Podia.</div><div><br></div><div><em>If you’ve ever been frustrated by following the “playbook” or trying to hit …questionable… KPIs, you know how it feels to have your creativity limited. </em></div><div><br></div><div>We’re not interested in a cobbled-together playbook of “best practices” or arbitrary goals. Everything we do at Podia starts with the creator and continues to the business — we want to do what works, and that means looking past playbooks to find the real levers for growth. </div><div><br></div><div>In this role, you’ll work with the VP of Marketing to write a <em>new</em> playbook and run with it.</div><div><br></div><div><em>If you’ve had to share results with other departments (or get sucked into enablement, or deal with fire drills when other teams don’t hit their goals), you know what it’s like to do everything right and still feel like things went wrong. </em></div><div><br></div><div>Podia is 100% self-serve. There is no sales team. Marketing finds and converts the entire pipeline, and the recent switch to a freemium model means the pipeline is full and growing. </div><div><br></div><div>If you’re still excited after reading that, let’s get into the details.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Requirements</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for someone with:</div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>The drive to hunt down every opportunity to grow the business. Improving the messages in our lifecycle marketing? Capturing high-intent search traffic via new comparison pages? Revising our top help docs? Generating UGC through the community? Reviewing the messages in in-app onboarding? You can help across every channel, and the right person for this role is eager to roll up their sleeves and get to work on whatever area of the business is the biggest opportunity right now.</li>
<li>An eye for great messaging. Across every channel, the message matters. The right person for this role knows how to create a message that resonates, and they know how to incorporate that message into all the marketing a company does. The right person for this role is a really excellent writer. </li>
<li>The drive to keep learning. You are a student of marketing, and you seek out every opportunity to learn more about your craft.</li>
<li>A love for digging into what creators need. We do a lot of customer research (dozens of interviews, transcript analysis, surveys, etc.), and your job is to understand both what creators want to hear and what they need to hear, so that you can help them be more successful.</li>
<li>A creative mind for distribution. Email, social, SEO…those are only starting points. You’re always thinking about how to get more eyes on your work by tying it to larger campaigns, involving other companies/creators, making it more interesting, and generally finding new ways to be found. </li>
<li>Writing and coaching skills. This is a player-coach role that will involve both managing and execution.</li>
<li>At least 4 hours overlap with US Eastern Time  </li>
<li>Years of experience isn’t the most important criterion, but you probably have 8+ years of experience in a content, product marketing, or growth role and a few years’ experience as a people manager</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>We get hundreds of job applications for every open role. If you’d like some tips on how to stand out, read <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/LenMarkidan/status/1151653927206707201"">this thread by our COO, Len Markidan</a>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>It’d be REALLY great if you also: </strong></div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>Have created and/or sold an online course, membership, coaching service, or download</li>
<li>Have worked with digital creators</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>These are nice-to-haves, but not requirements. Don’t be discouraged if they don’t apply to you. If you’re confident you’re otherwise perfect for this role, please apply!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Benefits</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Here’s what you’ll get if you join Podia:</div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>Competitive compensation. We want to hire the best people, and we’re ready to pay for them. We use a standardized salary scale set at the 90th percentile of US salaries for each role—regardless of where you are in the world 💰</li>
<li>Ultimate flexibility. We try to have some overlap time every day, but outside of that, work whenever and wherever you work best 🗺️</li>
<li>Extreme autonomy. No micromanaging here. After onboarding, you’ll be given high-level direction and then left to solve it the way you feel is best. 📚</li>
<li>That said, the rest of the team is always ready to lend a hand—or even an ear if you just need to bounce some ideas 💡</li>
<li>You’ll be working with a diverse team from a range of countries and backgrounds. We work hard to make Podia an inclusive workplace for everyone 🌈</li>
<li>We have a rapidly growing base of passionate customers. Your work will be seen and appreciated by many people ❤️</li>
<li>Great benefits including three weeks paid vacation (plus another week during the December holidays), sabbaticals every three years, professional development credit, paid family leave, a new laptop every three years, and more ☺️</li>
<li>401(k) match, health insurance, and other medical benefits (US-based employees) 💊</li>
<li>(Paid for) annual retreats to spend time with the team and have fun together ✈️</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>Sound like you? Want to be part of a smart, nimble, motivated team working hard to build something big?</div><div><br></div><div>Named one of the “Best Remote Companies to Work For in 2022” by We Work Remotely, we’ve been around since 2014, have the greatest customers in the world, and a team that will stop at nothing to help our creators win. If this sounds like something you’re interested in, we’d love to hear from you! 📣</div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>About the hiring process:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Interested in joining our team? Great!</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll begin reviewing applications immediately, and continue to review them as they come in. There's no benefit to applying in the first five minutes, and we'd rather you take your time. We heavily weigh the answers to our application form rather than data from LinkedIn or resumes. We typically reduce the candidate pool down to a small handful who move on to a small test project.</div><div><br></div><div>The project phase is a short paid test project, run very much like something you could expect to do if you were hired for the role. We’ll give you a week to complete the project, but expect that you’ll only need ~4 hours.</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll review the test projects, provide feedback in a single revision round for promising projects, and then based on the results of the revision round, select candidates to go on for an interview.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll have four total interviews over Zoom, including:</div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>The VP of Marketing (Hiring manager)</li>
<li>The COO</li>
<li>The content team</li>
<li>The CEO</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>The last interview will be with Spencer, our CEO, who can answer any questions you have about the broader goals and workings of the company.</div><div><br></div><div>After that, we'll decide on our final candidates and ask for professional references from both a previous co-worker and a manager. We'll reach out to those references to set up a brief 10 minute call or email.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, all going well, we'll make a written offer to the successful candidate🥳</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking forward to chatting 🙂</div>

</div><div>We're a small team (18 people in total) but despite that we've more than doubled our users and revenue every year since we launched. We're also fully profitable.</div><div>
<br><strong>Our approach to customers</strong>
</div><div>We think that companies who look after their customers will always succeed in the long run. We go out of our way to provide amazing customer service every time, even for people who aren't paying us anything. If in doubt, we'll always put our customers over our own profits.

</div><div>This role is focused on providing our customers with exceptional support to help solve their problems.<br><br>
</div><div>The ideal candidate has excellent written communication skills (English fluent or native level), is technically-savvy, has great problem solving ability, and most importantly, displays empathy for people. <br><br>
</div><div>This is a full-time remote role, however, we are open to flexible/part-time schedules (e.g. working 3 to 4 days a week). </div><div><strong><br>General skills/attributes</strong></div><ul><li>
<strong>Written communication skills</strong> - the primary job will be providing clear and succinct written responses to queries via our customer support platform Intercom.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>
<strong>Technical knowledge</strong> - you'll need to be technically savvy and understand modern software - you're likely to use various SaaS tools as part of your daily life and can show your experience with the web from past projects/experience (e.g. maybe you have designed and coded a website in the past, written javascript code, built a database).</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>
<strong>Problem solving ability</strong> - you'll need to be comfortable dealing with ambiguity, and have the ability to ask appropriate questions to understand issues fully.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>
<strong>Empathy and patience</strong> - we expect you to take your time with customers, and in doing so provide people with an exceptional customer experience.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>
<strong>SaaS/startup experience</strong> - any previous experience at a startup/software company providing customer support would be seen as a bonus (but not essential).</li></ul><div><strong><br>Role duties</strong></div><ul>

<li>Sharing feedback and suggestions with the product team on how Milanote can be improved.</li>
<li>Contributing to our help centre knowledge base to make it easier for customers to find answers to their problems.</li>
</ul><div><strong><br>Your location</strong></div><div>This is a remote position, but you will ideally be based in North America - working Pacific Standard Time so there's cross-over with the current support team (which is based in North America) and the rest of the Milanote team (which is based in Melbourne, Australia).<br><br>
</div><div>All our support is handled over the internet, we don't offer video or phone support.<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Employment basis</strong></div><ul>
<li>Full-time or part-time options (minimum of 3 to 4 days a week). </li>
<li>All the support will be carried out remotely via the Internet - so you can be based wherever it suits you best.</li>
<li>If you're currently studying, or at home raising kids - the part-time approach could fit really well into your daily life, equally the full-time approach has scope for growth into other parts of the business.</li>
<li>If you're applying outside of Australia, you'll be on an ongoing contract</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Application process</strong></div><ul>
<li>Please provide a cover letter and answer the question asking why you'd like to join Milanote</li>

<div><strong>$60k per year: $30 per hour, 40 hours per week.</strong></div><div>Our team is 100% remote and distributed across the world. We have team members in Australia, the US, Canada, Thailand, Germany, Argentina, South Africa, the UK, and Romania. It doesn't matter where you live or what time zone you're in.<br><br>
</div><div>Your main responsibility will be to reply to customers asking for help with WP All Export and WP All Import. You need to love to help others and be able to keep it friendly even when dealing with difficult customers. You need to enjoy the whole process of turning anxious, confused, or angry customers into happy ones. You must be an excellent writer. We want our support replies to be friendly, easy to understand, and concise.<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Flexibility</strong></div><div>We are a small team but we try to give everyone as much flexibility as possible. Flexibility means that you can work in the mornings, or the evenings, or both, or in the middle of the night, or whatever. It means you can take two weeks off to go on a trip. It means you can wake up and decide you don't feel like working and take the day off without telling anyone.<br><br>
</div><div>We aim to be as asynchronous as possible. We hate meetings, live chat, Slack, etc because it causes interruptions. You will have a list of prioritized tasks assigned to you, and we'll do our absolute best to leave you alone so that you can work on them in peace on your own time.<br><br>
</div><div>These do a good job describing how we work:</div><ul>

</ul><div>As a remote company, it's important to us to keep a strong line between our personal life and our work. Some places like to tell their employees they are joining a family. They have regular events unrelated to work like social chat rooms, hangouts over Zoom, etc. This is just another way for these companies to emotionally manipulate people into doing more work. You have an actual family and working with Soflyy means you can organize your work around the rest of your life, using your time as you see fit.<br><br>
</div><div>For most of us here, that is the primary draw. If you take a look at https://www.wpallimport.com/about/, you will notice that we have a lot of people who have worked here for many years. Our employee attrition rate is approximately zero, and we think the flexibility we offer is the primary reason.<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Responsibilities</strong></div><ul>
<li>Responding to customer support inquiries</li>
<li>Adding to and improving our documentation</li>
<li>Aggregating customer feedback and assisting us with development/product roadmap decisions</li>
<li>Writing concise bug reports based on support tickets that are a result of bugs in WP All Export or WP All Import</li>
<li>Testing development versions of WP All Import and WP All Export</li>
<li>Developing add-ons for WP All Import</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Requirements</strong></div><div>The only thing we care about is the ability to provide high-quality customer support to our clients. The more of these boxes you can tick the better, in descending order of importance:</div><ul>
<li>Minimum availability of 30 hours per week.</li>
<li>Flawless written English.</li>
<li>Expert-level WordPress knowledge. Extensive experience with WordPress including troubleshooting, debugging, plugin development, and WordPress database structure.</li>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> 
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href=""https://visible.vc"">https://visible.vc</a>
</p>

<h3><strong>Welcome!</strong></h3><p><a href=""https://visible.vc/"">Visible</a> is on a mission to help startup founders succeed. We’re achieving this by building best-in-class tools for startups and the venture capital investors who back them.</p><p>Visible is a profitable, established software startup made up of 13 fully remote teammates across the globe and has been set up this way since Visible was founded in 2015 (we have this whole remote work thing down).</p><h3><strong>Role Overview:</strong></h3><p>We are looking for a full-stack, mid-to-senior-level engineer to join our small engineering team and help scale our product to support our next stage of growth. Here is what to expect:</p><p>Our stack includes a Ruby on Rails API, PostgreSQL, Redis and Ember.js. We deploy to Heroku and Vercel and use Docker for local development. We have many different challenges that range from implementing product features to DevOps-type work and performance optimization. Other notable tools &amp; frameworks you will be working with include Tailwind CSS, AWS, Mobiledoc, and a lot of 3rd party APIs.</p><p>We favor full-stack engineers who have a good understanding of the entire scope of an application, but you don’t need to know both Rails and Ember to apply (however, for this position experience with one of the js frameworks is preferred and Ember experience is a big bonus).</p><p>You will work closely with our engineering team, product designer, and CEO, helping guide product direction and execution. Some things you might find yourself working on in the first couple of months:</p><ul>
<li><p>Participate in a <a href=""https://basecamp.com/shapeup"">cycle</a> where you are actively pitching, shaping, and building product features.</p></li>
<li><p>Build new and improve existing <a href=""https://visible.vc/integrations/"">integrations</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Help rebuild our marketing website.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pair with other engineers on the team and our product designer, participate in engineering calls (we do weekly mob programming sessions).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Working at Visible</strong></h3><p>We empower our people. As long as it is aligned with the company vision, everyone has a lot of liberty in choosing what to work on. We have a combined approach, both data-driven and user-driven. We work hard to create a culture where people ask questions and challenge what is being worked on.</p><p>Given that we are distributed, we end up working across multiple time zones and put an emphasis on being able to work asynchronously.</p><ul>
<li><p>We document everything we do in Notion, Slack, and GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>We use Slack for daily lightweight stand-ups.</p></li>
<li><p>We meet virtually as a team 3x per week. This typically includes an all-hands, product standup, and a fun wild card day (we often play codenames or <a href=""http://jackbox.tv/"">jackbox.tv</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Offsites throughout the year for fun and strategic planning.</p></li>
</ul><p>We have adopted a modified version of the ""<a href=""https://basecamp.com/shapeup"">Shape Up</a>"" process that fits our business and workflow. It allows us to build a high-quality product, take time to cool down, and not have to worry about looking at roadmaps that will change in the next six weeks anyway.</p><p>We have a full-time product designer, but everyone on the team is capable of producing shippable UIs and we really value a good sense of aesthetics.</p><p>We care more about quality than quantity. We spend time reducing our code and product debt. We pair whenever it is needed, we test our code, and we code review every line that goes in production. It is a great way to ensure quality and learn from each other.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Qualifications &amp; What We’re Looking For:</strong></h3><p>The following are all guide rails. Don't feel like you need to neatly check each box. If you love the role, we'd love to hear from you.</p><ul>
<li><p>You have at least 2 years of production experience with Rails/Ruby and/or Ember</p></li>
<li><p>You are comfortable working with multiple levels of the stack (JS, backend, database)</p></li>
<li><p>You want to be part of a small, growth-minded team</p></li>
<li><p>You care about writing clear, well-tested, maintainable code</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Bonus points if you</strong></p><ul>
<li><p>Worked on Ember projects before (and enjoyed it)</p></li>
<li><p>Have experience working with 3rd-party APIs, designing RESTfull APIs</p></li>
<li><p>Have experience or interest in DevOps</p></li>
<li>
<p>Have previous experience building a startup product for scale</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Why Choose Visible:</strong></h3><p>💥Visible Impact: We’re a small yet highly efficient team. This means your work will have a direct and visible impact on the growth of our company.</p><p>💵 Ownership: Both in the work you do and equity in the company.</p><p>✈️ Flexibility: Fully remote work (able to work within at least 3 hours of US eastern time zone).</p><p>💻 Tech: We provide the tools you need to get your job done.</p><p>⚕️Benefits: 100% Health, Dental, and Vision coverage + 401(k)</p><p>🌴 Team Offsites: Two paid team offsites per year (the last few offsites were in Mexico, Barcelona, and Amsterdam).</p><p>📖 Vacation Time:  We all need a break sometimes.

<li><p>Part I: Phone Screen with a team member. We'd love to hear about your development experience but more importantly answer any questions that you have.</p></li>

<div>👋 Thanks for stopping by and learning more about this role at Sitemate! ✨🏗️</div><div><br></div><div>We’d love to hear from you 🙂 👩‍💻👩🏽‍💻🧑🏿‍💻👨🏻‍💻</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Brief overview of this role at Sitemate:</strong></div><ul>
<li>We are looking for a senior level mobile / full stack software engineer to join our engineering team and help lead our two React Native mobile projects.</li>
<li>This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy around your work on mobile projects. Maybe you are working in a bigger team and don’t have any opportunities to take a lead role. Maybe you’ve worked in startups or had your own startup that has finished up, and you want to join a startup team that move quickly and place a huge emphasis on product and engineering.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to pull responsibility and technical ownership, and make it your own area of expertise. You will have the opportunity to learn (and improve) complex mobile-specific challenges such as sharing components between mobile applications, full offline mode, real-time syncing between mobile and web and native multimedia uploading. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our Head of Product, Head of Design &amp; UX and product-focused CEO.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Employment Type:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Full-time.</li>

</li>
<li>We have equal opportunity for applicants of all genders, ethnicity and sexualities - Sitemate's team is proudly diverse.</li>
<li>You will have flexible working options - our team is a blend of fully remote and hubs around offices. People based in hub cities typically work in the office 2-3 days per week, and 2-3 days working from home.</li>
<li>You will be remunerated based on your performance. If you are performing well, you won’t need to wait 3 years or have to find better offers elsewhere to receive an increase to your remuneration. 7 out of the last 10 remuneration increases for Sitemate team members have been made pro-actively by management, without the individual needing to even raise the topic of remuneration.</li>
<li>You will get a laptop and a budget to set up your home office (standing desk, monitor, headphones etc).</li>
<li>You will be able to attend company-sponsored training, workshops or conferences that help with your role.</li>
<li>You will get additional benefits and support as parents - with paid leave for both primary and secondary carers (includes adoption), as well as support and leave for the tragic circumstances of stillbirth.</li>
<li>You will get equity options and ownership in Sitemate on a standard vesting schedule. See here a general overview of how this works: <a href=""https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/"">https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/</a>
</li>
<li>Sitemate has grown from 5 people in 2018 to now over 40, and we’re now moving into the next stage of growing to 100 people! We have a product that customers are strongly engaged with, and every month we get around 300-400 new leads whilst spending $0 on marketing and 0 cold calling.</li>
<li>Sitemate’s founders have diverse backgrounds - one with coming from engineering on major infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges and tunnels, the second coming from product and graphic design. This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.</li>
<li>Sitemate graduated from Australia’s #1 Technology Company Accelerator - Startmate (complete coincidence on the names… 😅).</li>
<li>Sitemate has strong financial backing from Blackbird (Australia and NZ’s #1 Vc) and Shearwater Growth Capital (founded by two Directors of WiseTech - a $14B software company for the logistics industry).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What is the working environment like at Sitemate?</strong></div><ul>
<li>We are very transparent - monthly allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.</li>
<li>We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.</li>
<li>We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.</li>
<li>You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.</li>
<li>You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand - no worries. If you want to block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.</li>
<li>We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What does Sitemate do, exactly?</strong></div><ul>
<li>Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.</li>
<li>Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour due to covid-19, Generation Z starting to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.</li>
<li>See here an example wind farm project that is powered by Sitemate: <a href=""https://roadbridge.ie/projects/beinn-an-tuirc-windfarm-phase-3/"">https://roadbridge.ie/projects/beinn-an-tuirc-windfarm-phase-3/</a>

</li>
<li>Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.</li>

</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What will I be doing day to day in this role?</strong></div><ul>
<li>Work with the mobile team on our two mobile products &amp; their backends - developing new features, fixing bugs, re-architecting core components functions.</li>
<li>Help set and ensuring all work is working towards the technical vision.</li>
<li>Working closely with our delivery team (product owner &amp; QA Engineers), product team and broader engineering team. As a senior engineer, you will be expected to coordinate the mobile projects and will be a point of contact for our CTO and CEO.</li>
<li>Assisting our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?</strong></div><ul>
<li>As you will be working directly with our CTO (a former founder) and our Founder/CEO, you will need to be able to manage communication, problem solving and your own technical execution/contributions.</li>
<li>You will need to be acutely aware of your own productivity and ensure that you are always driving towards outcomes that will impact users.</li>
<li>Our mobile products seem simple to our users, but contain a high degree of technical complexity - from shared components across multiple mobile apps, to backend services that only serve the mobile client - there will be a lot to learn.</li>
<li>We will be completely re-architecting our product’s hierarchy in the next 12 months from a rigid tree/folder structure to a flexible tree/folder structure, which will nearly certainly require refactoring every part of our product 🙃.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (Ideally most but not all)</strong></div><ul>
<li>Javascript/Typescript experience is preferred.</li>
<li>React Native experience is preferred.</li>
<li>Node, Serverless &amp; AWS experience a bonus.</li>
<li>MongoDB &amp; DynamoDB experience is a bonus.</li>
<li>Native mobile experience is a bonus (as per above, we are planning on forking a portion of our React Native app to enable the usage of native components for multimedia uploading).</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>FAQs</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>What does the application and interview process look like? And how long does it take?</strong></div><div>Once you have expressed interest, we have an online application form that is connected to our internal systems. Following on from this, we have a combination of an online self service quiz and interviews. Usually it will only take a day or two to hear an update on next steps, and the overall process for those who make it all the way through, will usually take a couple of weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>*Note for remote candidates - Sitemate has a standardised COL (Cost of Living) multiplier that is applied to the remuneration bands shown, based on your location, it may go up or down.</div>

<div>
<strong>TL;DR: </strong><a href=""https://www.wallstreetzen.com/""><strong>WallStreetZen</strong></a><strong> is a fast-growing financial software &amp; media company. We’re looking for an experienced operations / project manager to take control of our day-to-day admin and operational work to help drive the business forward. Your mission will be to make our scrappy startup run like a well-oiled machine.</strong>
</div><div>
<br>This role is fully remote. You can be located anywhere - as long as you can accommodate at least 4 hours of overlap with Hong Kong working hours (8am-6pm UTC+8).</div><div>
<br>Keep reading if you have experience in an ops/project manager type role, thrive on solving problems, pushing things forward, designing and managing systems - and are eager to work with a small, high-performing remote team!</div><div>
<br><strong><br>A bit about us</strong>
</div><div>
<br>WallStreetZen’s core product is a <a href=""https://www.wallstreetzen.com/about"">B2C SaaS tool</a> that helps retail investors analyze stocks.</div><div>
<br>We’re striving to build the best product in a competitive category that includes names like Yahoo Finance.</div><div>
<br>But despite our ambitions, we’re not on a traditional venture track - we plan to grow organically and profitably.</div><div>
<br>This means you get the benefits of working for an ambitious startup - quality, impactful work with a small team of high performers - but you also get to prioritize family, relationships and mental health.</div><div>
<br>While our core product is our stock analysis tool, the fastest-growing segment of our business is financial publishing. What started as a content marketing strategy has evolved into a full-blown financial publishing business! We <a href=""https://www.wallstreetzen.com/blog"">publish</a> reviews, comparison articles, and how-tos on financial topics.<br><br>
</div><div>More content publishing means more revenue, but also more headaches. That’s where you come in!</div><div>
<br>Still with me? Great. Please say “I'm still with you” somewhere in your application.<br><br>
</div><div><strong><br>Why you might be excited about us</strong></div><ol>
<li>
<strong>Results-oriented.</strong> Over 1 million ppl used WallStreetZen last month - but we’re still only 3 full time team members and a bunch of part-time freelancers. So you'll get a ton of stuff done without office politics or bureaucracy.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fast career advancement.</strong> You’ll get in on the ground floor of a growing company. You’ll work directly with the founder and have a major impact on the business.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Find balance.</strong> We work hard but also highly value balance. We care about family and your own personal development.<br><br>

</li>
<li>
<strong>We’ll grow together.</strong> We care a ton about your satisfaction and job happiness, and will help prep you for whatever you're looking for in the future.<br><br>
</li>
</ol><div><strong>Why you might not be excited about us</strong></div><ol>
<li>We're small (3 full time people in the company right now and ~10 part-time freelancers), so if you like more established companies, it's not (yet) the right time.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Our customers love us, but there's still a lot we can improve. It's a great position to be in, but it means there's some jank. (Nothing too scary! 😃).<br><br>
</li>
<li>We have high standards when it comes to product, and it applies to operations as well. We sweat the details.<br><br>
</li>
</ol><div><strong>What you will be working on</strong></div><div>
<br>You’ll work directly with the founder to remove operational and administrative bottlenecks, enabling the WSZ team to focus on product, marketing, and editorial.<br><br>
</div><div>You’ll work with our head of content to scale content production. You’ll recruit and manage writers. You’ll build flexible processes to enable the WSZ team to consistently deliver high quality, optimized content that’s useful for Google searchers and drives business goals.</div><div>
<br>You’ll make the whole company’s day-to-day operations smooth like butter so we can grow revenue.</div><div>
<br>Here are some of the areas you’ll own:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Content Operations<br></strong><br><ul>
<li>Through your operational excellence, solve bottlenecks and enable our SEOs, editors and writers to produce high quality, optimized content at scale.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Find writing talent (job postings, fielding questions, initial screening interviews, onboarding)<br><br>
</li>
<li>Build lightweight processes to check for quality and ensure we’re hitting our business goals.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Work with our affiliate partners to understand their compliance requirements - and build processes and checks to ensure we’re compliant<br><br>
</li>
<li>Set up automations whenever possible to make our processes more efficient<br><br>
</li>
<li>Take our best practices that are driving revenue, and make sure they’re rolled out across the team as we scale<br><br>
</li>
<li>Design, build and run a system to ensure our content is continuously updated and improved.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>SOPs &amp; Playbooks<br></strong><br><ul>

<li>Ensure payments go out on time<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Admin<br></strong><br><ul>

<li>Managing / triaging founder inbox &amp; calendar management<br><br>
</li>
<li>Run the hiring process for an exec assistant<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><div>You’ll have some management and oversight responsibilities, but this is will start primarily as an individual contributor role. You’ll be rolling up your sleeves and getting a lot done. We all wear multiple hats.</div><div>
<br>This is a full-time remote role, open to all timezones. However, it will require at least 4 hours of overlap with HK working hours (UTC+8 - 8am-6pm).<br><br>
</div><div><strong><br>A bit about you</strong></div><div>
<br>You’ll thrive if you have these qualities/experience:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>3+ years experience</strong> in an operational or project management position of some type, ideally in some type of digital industry.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You are an extremely organized individual</strong>. You'll be designing, building and managing the systems that move the business from 1 → 10.<br><br>

</li>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Systems thinker.</strong> If a problem occurs twice, you look for a permanent fix.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>High levels of attention to detail.</strong> Does it pain you to see a missing comma? Do you notice when an H2 has too little padding above it?<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>SOP / Process nerd</strong> - Does a fully ticked off checklist get your engine going? Does seeing a new Zapier integration fire for the first-time trigger a dopamine rush?<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Able to leverage automation and VAs:</strong> able to automate and delegate to maximize efficiency.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>No task is too small:</strong> “how you do anything is how you do everything”, you pride yourself on doing the job right, even when it's a “low level” task.<br><br>

  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> GMass, Inc.

</p>

<div>Hi, I'm Ajay, and I run GMass, a popular email automation platform. We've grown every single year and we're finally at the point where I want to offload the handling of our email deliverability work onto someone else. <br> <br><strong>Want to ease my workload? </strong><br> <br>This is a technical role that requires a deep understanding of how email is sent and received. You should already be an expert with SMTP, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. It's strange, because I've interviewed dozens of candidates over the years who claim these protocols on their resume but then can't answer even the most fundamental questions about email authentication.<br><br>You should understand the factors that affect email deliverability and how to resolve them or work around them. GMass sends 5-7 million emails daily on behalf of tens of thousands of daily active users, and it will be your job to ensure that every single one of them lands in the Inbox. <br><br><em>Just kidding! </em>If anyone ever requires that of you, run far away.<br> <br><strong>Issues we encounter on a regular basis: </strong>
</div><ul>
<li>A user is claiming that it's our fault that their emails are going to Spam. <em>Is it actually our fault?</em>
</li>
<li>A domain or IP has been blacklisted. Need to figure out a solution. </li>
<li> We've received an abuse complaint AWS, and we have 24 hours to respond or they start shutting down our EC2 instances.</li>
<li>A domain used for click tracking has ended up on the Google Safe Browsing list. Uh oh, the red screen of death!</li>
<li>The SendGrid compliance department says our mail stream doesn't conform to their policies. </li>
</ul><div><strong>Technical skills that you should have: </strong></div><ul>
<li>You have a deep understanding of how email is sent.</li>
<li>You should understand the SMTP protocol.</li>
<li>You should have a thorough understanding of email authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.</li>
<li>You understand the DNS system and its impact on email.</li>
<li>You know how to query databases. You don't need to be a full fledged DBA, but the more SQL you know, the better, because then you can analyze deliverability trends across the whole system.</li>
<li>You understand Inbox vs Promotions vs Spam placement and factors that impact it. </li>
<li>You've worked with transactional email services like SendGrid, Mailgun, Mandrill, and Amazon SES. </li>
</ul><div>
<strong>What would make you a dream candidate</strong><br>You've demonstrated thought leadership and original insight into email deliverability issues. You regularly publish your thoughts. You've been a postmaster for an Email Service Provider before. Your writing is so good that we are comfortable sending your article to our 1M+ user list.<br><br><strong>What probably doesn't make you qualified</strong><br>You've run a mail server out of your basement where you've hosted email for family and friends. While that gives you some understanding of email servers, it doesn't give you the deep experience needed for troubleshooting delivery issues and coming up with creative solutions to blocking. Long gone are the days where to unblock an IP, you just fill out a form on the blacklist's site and <em>voila!</em> -- problem solved.<br> <br><strong>More about me: </strong><br>I created GMass seven years ago, and I love the system, company, and user base. I believe GMass has a shot at becoming a tech household name. I live in Dayton, Ohio with my wife and kids. I work a lot, because I love my work. You can find me on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/parttimesnob"">@PartTimeSnob</a>. I'm on LinkedIn too but not as active there as on Twitter:  <a href=""https://linkedin.com/in/ajaygoel999"">https://linkedin.com/in/ajaygoel999</a> <br> <br><strong>Ready to rescue me? </strong><br>I prefer you send me an email directly to ajay AT wordzen DOT com, and tell me about yourself and how you fit with this role. The subject line can be whatever you like, but please include the word ""deliverability"" in it so I don't miss your email. My policy is that if you put effort into your email to me, you'll get a response from me. <br><br><strong>Compensation:</strong><br> This is a high-level, full-time position. We don't set traditional salary ranges for open roles. Rather, we aim for the role to offer you the highest compensation you've ever had.<br><br>

</p>

<div>
<strong>The Basics</strong><br><br>
</div><div>Giant Swarm is looking for a <strong>VP Finance.</strong> You’ll be our ‘financial face’ and deal with ‘all things coins’ which means Corporate Finance, Controlling, Tax, and Accounting. We understand finance as an enabling function for our teams and future growth. We have called it ‘VP Finance’ but there is no finance team, yet.<br><br>
</div><div>Giant Swarm is a fast-growing open source infrastructure management platform used by modern enterprises. Our vision is to empower developers around the world to ship great products. We are a diverse, 32 hour workweek, fully remote (since 2014)and an experienced team that is growing and spread across Europe — with a headquarters in Cologne.<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Your Job</strong></div><ul>
<li>In short: You bolster all of our Finance and Accounting processes and feel responsible for them. You work strategically and operationally. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You properly build out the accounting/tax side of the organization and processes around monthly accounting/reporting, revenue recognition, payroll, insurance, and taxes as well as shareholder reports. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You manage external bookkeepers, lawyers, tax consultants, and payroll providers. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You oversee accounts payable and receivable and take care of Cash Flow Management. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You set the direction for Giant Swarm's accounting and business systems to ensure proper automation. You being the single point of failure is not the goal. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You proactively identify areas to build and improve financial operations; being pragmatic is helpful here. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You provide the financial information that other business functions require to operate effectively and efficiently<br><br>
</li>
<li>You support business planning and decision making. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You deal with top tier investors and lenders to finance growth initiatives  .<br><br>
</li>
<li>You’ll take care of our ESOP Program and develop better or new ways so that our employees can participate in our success. <br><br>
</li>
</ul><div><strong>Requirements</strong></div><ul>
<li>You have gained experience in a finance function (tax, accounting, controlling) for at least 5 years and know the technology growth environment. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You like to be the go-to person for all finance-related issues, and you proactively search for areas where we need to improve. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You enjoy working closely with all other stakeholders and teaching and coaching them on financial issues. Please note, we have full financial transparency in the company, and everyone knows what is on the bank account.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>You like to get your hands dirty if needed. You are not alone in doing all the legwork, which is needed for your space, but you should not fear working operationally. You do not need to know how to code, but being a tool lover and having the will to automate things is a big plus. <br><br>
</li>
<li>You feel confident in speaking and dealing with top tier investors and choosing the right vehicle for financing growth initiatives.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Even though we are fully remote; you should speak German as the company is registered in Germany.<br><br>
</li>
<li>We call this position ‘VP Finance’ even though we do not have a big finance department yet, but this job has several leadership elements. But as we believe in lateral leadership, you should not be motivated by having power over people. What does leadership mean at Giant Swarm?

<h1>⭐ SUMMARY</h1><div>We are Pixellu, a software company on a mission to take the work out of running a photography business so photographers can do what they love. We are seeking a world-class Senior Product Manager to manage one of our three products. You’ll be working with the Head of Product, CEO, CTO, and fellow PMs to develop a product vision and execute on that vision with the help of designers and engineers.</div><h1>📷 ABOUT PIXELLU</h1><div>At Pixellu, we know professional photographers are frustrated with all of the tedious work required to run a successful photography business. Many get so overwhelmed, they end up quitting on their dream of having a photography career. That is why we create easy-to-use, time-saving software that takes the work out of running a photography business so photographers can get back to doing what they love.</div><div> </div><div>Pixellu was co-founded in 2010 by two wedding photographers. Faced with the challenges of long hours and endless tasks, we began asking ourselves, “How can we save valuable time, make more money, and get our lives back?” Our answer was technology. We started Pixellu with the idea that we could make money by providing an honest service that helped photographers save time and live more fulfilling lives. We believed that, by focusing on a great product and great service, we could build a business that not only does good, but also does well. </div><div> </div><div>Today, we are a team of 40 team members spread across 15 countries, serving tens of thousands of photographers in over 100 countries. </div><div> </div><div>Our vision is for Pixellu to become the foundation of more than 1 million successful photography businesses, so that photographers can focus on doing what they love while we automate the rest of their work. We are becoming the bridge between their camera and clients — all they would need to do is upload their photos to Pixellu. </div><div> </div><div>We embrace the spirit of autonomous teams that are empowered to change the photography world while having a healthy work-life balance. </div><div> </div><div>Learn more about us and why you’ll love working at Pixellu here: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/405889874"">https://vimeo.com/405889874</a>

<div><strong>About Popcorn Growth</strong></div><div>We are an award winning, Tiktok-first, influencer marketing agency and social media company, here to shake up stuffy, old-school agency practices. </div><div><br></div><div>We know that success on TikTok for brands depends on speed and efficiency.</div><div><br></div><div>We know that creators do their best work when we let them be the creatives.</div><div><br></div><div>We’ve operationalized the whole influencer marketing process so that we can help brands move at the speed of TikTok. </div><div>
<br>Now, we are looking for passionate industry disruptors who are ready to move as fast as we do.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br><strong>Sales Executive Job Description </strong>
</div><div><br></div><div><em>This is a fully-remote position. We just want the best, wherever you are.</em></div><div><br></div><div>In this position, you will be part of a dynamic and fast-paced team that values impact, efficiency and independence. As a fully remote company, all of our team members  are fully responsible  for their roles and sphere of influence.</div><div><br></div><div>Our clients are respected brands. You must be comfortable engaging senior stakeholders (VP of Marketing, CMOs) at high-value clients, providing expert insights on the influencer marketing and social media trends, and clearly establishing our value-add to the brands. </div><div><br></div><div>We pride ourselves on being thought leaders in it with our clients for the long run - no “Get 1 million followers in 3 days” or “Make $10,000 in a month”. </div><div><br></div><div>We are champions of “work smart<em>, and</em> hard” and are building for scale. If you are someone who would rather take 30-min figuring out how to optimize a process, than spend 10 minutes doing it manually every day, you are a great fit for our team. </div><div><br></div><div><strong>Sales Executive Requirements</strong></div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>Minimum college education</li>
<li>Either Marketing, Sales or Customer Success background</li>

<li>Ability to work under pressure and deal independently with senior stakeholders in brands</li>
<li>Prior experience as accounts management in a digital marketing or brand agency is a bonus</li>
</ul><div>
<br><br><br>
</div><div><strong>Your Goals</strong></div><div><br></div><div>You will start by receiving some leads from Popcorn Growth, and converting these clients with an entry level service (billing ~$50,000 over 6 months) that allows our clients to understand our unique proposition. Once you have built a network of clients, you are expected to source your own leads.</div><div><br></div><div>For reference, because of our strong value proposition, our standard campaigns take about [1 to 5 calls] to convert, and have a sales lead time of about 3 to 4 months. </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Hence, your goal is to achieve $800k of sales revenue in the first year.</strong> </div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Will you succeed in this role?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>People who excel in our environment are people who are fast, independent learners who can pick up concepts quickly. </div><div><br></div><div>Our training consists of:</div><ul>
<li>2-day Product and Value proposition training</li>
<li>Shadowing the Head of Sales on sales calls </li>
<li>Video recordings of sales calls and coaching</li>
<li>If you are confident that you can pick up quickly given a loosely structured but highly impactful training process, you are our person. </li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>Keys to success:</div><ul>
<li>You are extremely self-driven and loves challenges</li>
<li>You are disciplined, consistent, and do not take no for an answer.</li>
<li>You listen more than talk during client calls </li>
<li>You understand how to lead with thought leadership and offer value to prospects, (instead of hard-selling). People who are hard-sellers will <strong>not</strong> fit well with us. </li>
<li>You can think about your client/prospect accounts strategically, and can identify opportunities. </li>
<li>You are organized and you are on top of your pipeline and numbers. </li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Our Values</strong></div><ul>
<li>We think before we understand, and then we implement.</li>
<li>We prioritize high-impact actions.</li>
<li>We apply judgment on:</li>
<li>When to get involved and when to get out of the way.</li>
<li>When to be an independent problem solver and when to ask for help.</li>
<li>Good and fast is better than slow and perfect.</li>
<li>Stuff gets done, stuff gets done well.</li>
<li>There are days we are motivated, there are days we are not motivated. Every day, we are disciplined.</li>
<li>We trust each other because of transparency.</li>
<li>We reward performance, not hours worked, not tenure.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong><br>We are:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>●      NOT Looking to be perfect/excel at every task. We are a rapidly growing startup that values practicality. We look for team members who find the happy medium between getting all the information and getting the job done<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>●      NOT going to micromanage. You are encouraged to ask: if this goes wrong, will it significantly affect the company/process/client? If not, make a decision and move on. <br><br>
</div><div>
<br>●      NOT shy from being brutally honest with your teammates.<br><br>

</div><div><strong>Self-Starters &amp; Creative Problem Solvers</strong></div><div>We’re a team of self-starters who are not afraid to jump into new systems we don’t understand, come up with a proposed solution before asking for help, and are always open to trying &amp; learning new things.

</div><div><strong>A culture of electronic music lovers &amp; makers.</strong></div><div>Many of <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fk0KSjG22PI9cnNbwpFuSBynj2P0EjnSCA6OpA4ZHJE/edit"">Proton’s team</a> are also DJs, producers, or label managers. While not a must-have, we’re looking for team members who are also passionate about electronic music.

In practice, this means our company doesn’t aim to grow rapidly at the cost of compromising our values: we often prioritize engineering projects that keep Proton aligned with our values over other projects that might make our work easier &amp; make the company more money. This is key for candidates to understand and embrace.</div><div><br></div>

</ul><h1>🚀 ABOUT PIXELLU</h1><div>At Pixellu, we know professional photographers are frustrated with all of the tedious work required to run a successful photography business. Many get so overwhelmed, they end up quitting on their dream of having a photography career. That is why we create easy-to-use, time-saving software that takes the work out of running a photography business so photographers can get back to doing what they love, creating art.<br><br>Pixellu was co-founded in 2010 by two wedding photographers. Faced with the challenges of long hours and endless tasks, we began asking ourselves, “How can we save valuable time, make more money, and get our lives back?” Our answer was technology. We started Pixellu with the idea that we could make money by providing an honest service that helped photographers save time and live more fulfilling lives. We believed that, by focusing on a great product and great service, we could build a business that not only does good, but also does well. <br> <br>Today, we are a team of 35 team members spread across 15 countries, serving tens of thousands of photographers in over 100 countries. <br><br>Our vision is for Pixellu to become the foundation of more than 1 million successful photography businesses, so that photographers can focus on doing what they love while we automate the rest of their work. We are becoming the bridge between their camera and clients — all they would need to do is upload their photos to Pixellu. <br><br>We embrace the spirit of autonomous teams that are empowered to change the photography world while having a healthy work-life balance. <br><br>Learn more about us and why you’ll love working at Pixellu here: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/405889874"">https://vimeo.com/405889874</a>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> NYC, SF, and TLV
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href=""https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral"">https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral</a>
</p>

<div>
<a href=""https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral"">A·Team</a> is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. <br><br>After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.<br><br>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>How to apply:<br></strong>Go here: <a href=""https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral"">https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral</a> + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.<br><strong><br>What you’ll do:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.</li>
<li>Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. </li>
<li>You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. </li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.</li>
<li>Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.</li>
<li>The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Who A</strong>·<strong>Team is </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> for:</strong>
</div><ul>
<li>People looking for small gigs.</li>
<li>Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.</li>
<li>Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>Our long-term vision:<br></strong><a href=""https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral"">A·Team</a> is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them ""unhirables"": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. </div><div>
<br>To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.</div>
