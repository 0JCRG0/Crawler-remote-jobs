We thoughtfully choose our work orchestration stack to enable all team members to work in a way that helps them to be most productive without being cumbersome. Three things every Sensei Loves:  Four-day work week. Five days of work per week is an arbitrary number that doesn’t mean more productivity! We’ve adopted a Monday to Thursday four-day work week at Sensei Labs — every Sensei gets every Friday off.
