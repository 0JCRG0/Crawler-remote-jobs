discussing the smallest of UX detailsWere seeking a fulltime remote UX Auditor for our auditing teamBaymard Institute is an independent ecommerce UX research organization  beyond conducting our own largescale research studies for Baymard Premium we also conduct clientspecific work in the form of UX Audits The Job As a UX Auditor you will be responsible for conducting clientspecific UX audits 90 of the job will beAnalyzing the UX of some of the worlds largest ecommerce sites  this is performed as an extremely detailed heuristic evaluation using a proprietary system and workflow where Baymards research catalog of 700 ecommerce UX parameters is used as the weighted heuristic anchoring the audit in solid UX researchIdentifying and prioritizing findings for the client site into a set of suggestions for improvementWriting it all into a 50150 page report and presenting it to the client in a 2hour video conference callDepending on your qualifications other roles will be possible over time Qualifications Were looking for the following qualifications for this role77 Firm understanding of UX and user behavior  in this role you will not conduct usability testing yourself with endusers but rather be performing heuristic evaluations  analyzing the UX of a website across Baymards 700 parametersheuristics This will require a firm understanding of UX and user behavior Having experience with performing usability testing remote or inperson testing will be a plus but is not a strict requirement67 Finding attention to detail exciting  in each audit we analyze the client site across 700 UX parameters each of these 700 parameters then has 47 defined implementation nuances the audit must account for This requires an extreme level of attention to detail and excitement for exploring the smallest of UI nuances of a site Our best auditors know all 700 parameters and most of the nuances within by memory57 Rigor over time  while the typical audit project lasts just around 2 weeks and youll therefore work for a new and interesting ecommerce site roughly every 2nd week  the auditing process itself and the underlying UX research dataset doesnt change that much So the UX Auditor role requires that you have a high degree of stability and will find it exciting to look for the same set of 700 ecommerce UX nuances all year round although obviously applying that dataset to a very wide variety of sites and clients47 Ability to communicate UX in writing  the primary deliverable for an auditor is the 50150 page audit report As the audit report relies on the foundation of Baymards vast catalog of UX research findings but at the same time is a bespoke consulting project  you as an Auditor have to be good at accurately describing complex flows and user behaviors in writing The audit reports are often read by a team with diverse backgrounds managers UXers designers and developers  they all need to understand the described UX issue in just 4 paragraphs of text47 Comfortable with client presentations  while audits are never presented inperson at the client offices due to global clients and somewhat short projects the audit report deliverable is always followed up with a 2hour conference call where you will be sharing your screen walking the client through the audit report and key findings Prior experience with client meetings and an ability to correctly answer general questions on anything related to ecommerce UX will be a plus but is not a requirement Full fluency in spoken English is a requirement other language skills are a plus27 Good understanding of webjargon  being able to describe the differences between autocomplete autofill and autocorrect on the spot will be a necessity when presenting and discussing your findings with a diverse set of clientsEach of

view the role description thereApplication linkIm building a startup in the B2B SaaS CRM and Sales Automation space and am looking for a technical cofounder Heres who I am where Im at and what Im looking forThe TeamI have over 10 years experience in B2B SaaS in various roles in product and revenue with 10 years in the specific domain I am building in Recently Ive been a key contributor and first nonfounder hire at an earlystage startup leading product and revenue and helping take the company to a 20 million exitI strive to be a decent and kind human who is passionate about delivering quality work but doesnt let it define my identity or compromise my characterThe OpportunityIm building a B2B SaaS CRM and Sales Automation Tool for small businesses agents consultants freelancers and other solopreneursThe initial idea came from my own experiences Ive always had various sidebusinesses and use a CRM to help me run and grow said businesses Ive always been dissatisfied with the tools that are currently out thereI spoke to people like me and found that they too had similar issues From there Ive developed an initial customer list and gotomarket plan centered around key partnerships referrals and cold emailI believe this product could be the foundation for a business worth at least 12 million in the next three years From there we could sell the business for that amount or moreWe could also coast and continue running the business into perpetuity with all the time and location freedom that it allows since a 12 million SaaS business would imply around 2 million in annual recurring revenue based on average historical B2B SaaS EV  Revenue multiplesGiven the rise and hype around AI there is also an opportunity here to leverage the customer base to test demand for addon products around AII dont think we should raise outside funding friends and family Im open to This way we get to keep our equity and independence pay ourselves accordingly and take the business where we see fitI understand that this opportunity comes with some riskSo why am I doing this Why do I think this is worth investing my time and money inSome things in our favorI have a combined 10 years experience in the domain I am building in and deeply understand the problems the customer base is trying to solveAside from being my own customer Ive had many conversations with the target market and have an initial list of prospectsThe market for the product is large with lots of competition The product category and featureset is welldefined This is good because this means we know that people will pay for the kind of thing were building and product requirements are better understood and defined compared to a less mature marketI have a strong understanding of the features needed for an MVP documented in a product requirements docI have initial mockupsI have experience being an early stage contributor in B2B SaaS and leading a company to exitOnce a customer base is built we can test demand for AI productsLastly I dont plan to raise institutional money beyond a friends and family round This will let us scale profitably by putting the customer firstYouYoull be responsible for all technical aspects of the business primarily the creation and maintenance of the web application from mockups to MVP to production Im at the very beginning of the process though as described above I have a clear vision for the business and productSince this is a startup every cofounder will end up fulfilling many roles and doing a variety of things but here is a more structured list of your responsibilitiesDevelop and maintain the web application endtoend from mockups to MVP and beyondDeliver responsive highperformance and compelling user interfacesLead the development and implementation of the technical aspects of the startupThe obvious requirement is proven experience in software development with understanding and experience in building a web application from mockups to working product Ideally you know what it takes to scale the application to thousands of usersIf youve done some or all of the following youll likely be a good candidate from a technical perspectiveBuilt and deployed projects that were used by lots of peopleBuilt B2B SaaS productsBuilt integrations with platforms like G Suite Zapier Salesforce SendGrid and the likeWorked with architectures that support
