all whove applied Im intending to go with a candidate who has already now appliedTheres a great problem in the WestFor all the news we read almost nobody pays attention to what foreign leaders actually sayOther than in extremely filtered form through our media  which often isnt faithful to the sentiment of whats been said  we dont hear from themContrast this with the 1960s and JFKs ambassador to Japan Edwin Reischauer making important cultural documentaries to help Americans better understand Japan and the Japanese way of perceiving the world httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvh9kL97FzucYPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone later went on to say I know of no other man who has so thoroughly understood JapanSuch diplomatic attempts at empathy have deteriorated sharply since And Id like to make a humble attempt at reviving the Reischauerian spiritFor the past year Ive been writing a fortnightly digest on Substack httpsedwardmdrucesubstackcom In the past few weeks Ive begun adapting these into video form  hoping in time to reach a wider audienceVideo 1 httpstwittercomEdwardMDrucestatus1674847420339847180 Video 2

theory journal whose core task is to spell out the evolving idea of socialism with Chinese characteristics For those not familiar Qiushi reads like a cross between the New Yorker and the Federal Register Published twice a month the magazine features lengthy essays thick pages and some of the finest writers in the party Each issue starts in the same way a reprint of a speech or essay by Xi Jinpingin a font distinct from the rest of the magazinesand then commentary and reports from the rest of the party stateTheres an English language version  httpenqstheorycn20200616c461019htm  but astonishingly to me Ive never once heard a Western commentator cite itIm looking for a research assistant whoi Actually wants to understand foreign leadersYou recognise that wanting to hear from the
