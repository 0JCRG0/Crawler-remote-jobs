Edward M. Druce: – Wanted: Research assistant (part-time) with deep interest in geopolitics and how the world works,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/edward-m-druce-wanted-research-assistant-part-time-with-deep-interest-in-geopolitics-and-how,Update 20 July Ive been inundated with applications Thanks to all whove applied Im intending to go with a candidate who has already now appliedTheres a great problem in the WestFor all the news we read almost nobody pays attention to what foreign leaders actually sayOther than in extremely filtered form through our media  which often isnt faithful to the sentiment of whats been said  we dont hear from themContrast this with the 1960s and JFKs ambassador to Japan Edwin Reischauer making important cultural documentaries to help Americans better understand Japan and the Japanese way of perceiving the world httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvh9kL97FzucYPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone later went on to say I know of no other man who has so thoroughly understood JapanSuch diplomatic attempts at empathy have deteriorated sharply since And Id like to make a humble attempt at reviving the Reischauerian spiritFor the past year Ive been writing a fortnightly digest on Substack httpsedwardmdrucesubstackcom In the past few weeks Ive begun adapting these into video form  hoping in time to reach a wider audienceVideo 1 httpstwittercomEdwardMDrucestatus1674847420339847180 Video 2 httpstwittercomEdwardMDrucestatus1674855464658427916 Video 3 httpstwittercomEdwardMDrucestatus1678908853407080448 I get through a prodigious amount of Western commentary  mainstream and alternative  but lack as we all do getting to actual primary source foreign leader materialThree such examples  that have potential to be illuminating to a Western audience if only they were covered1 A fivehour interview with former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett httpstwittercomhsustevestatus16244489657761423362 A very long fireside chat with Putin in October 2022 httpsvkcomvideo214192832456239041listlnixmnwTZ5qWUNnBhfUO  starting at 116003 Qiushi Dan Wang writing on thisThis year I read every issue of Qiushi translation Seeking Truth the partys CCPs flagship theory journal whose core task is to spell out the evolving idea of socialism with Chinese characteristics For those not familiar Qiushi reads like a cross between the New Yorker and the Federal Register Published twice a month the magazine features lengthy essays thick pages and some of the finest writers in the party Each issue starts in the same way a reprint of a speech or essay by Xi Jinpingin a font distinct from the rest of the magazinesand then commentary and reports from the rest of the party stateTheres an English language version  httpenqstheorycn20200616c461019htm  but astonishingly to me Ive never once heard a Western commentator cite itIm looking for a research assistant whoi Actually wants to understand foreign leadersYou recognise that wanting to hear from the likes of Putin directly doesnt mean agreeing with him  it simply means listening and trying to get an accurate picture of how he sees the worldii Has the instinct to know whats interestingimportant and can pull out bitesized timestamped clips that matterSuch an example with Putin  him getting annoyed at Western journalists httpsyoutubeppDbhWODDct3194 iii Loves to read You read books by Henry Kissinger  about China for funiv You believe the truth is more complicated than simple good guys versus bad guys narratives were fedv Has a desire to understand and disseminate the real workings of the worldAbout me In 2017 I cofounded a successful publishing company httpscourseconciergecom  I worked in the Prime Ministers office in the UK 10 Downing Street with the Prime Ministers chief of staff 202021 In 2016 I interned at The Spectator magazine  so have some minor background in journalismAt present my Substackvideos have a tiny following But my audience comprises important people  many who until recently ran the government in the UKI recently turned 30 and have the extreme good fortune of having time to determine what Id like to do next Its something in this general geopoliticalpeacemaking realmRight now this is something of an experiment so Im openminded on the number of hoursrate for the roleWhat I do know You can do this on your own time Complete flexibility in when you work Im not interested in where or even whether you went to school All that matters is youre curious insightful and determinedTo apply please write back with a short note as to why you think youd be a fit All I care about is your enthusiasm and fit for this role Please do not attach a rsumI wont be able to get back to everyone but for those who stand out I will be in touch to book a phone callIf you havent heard back within 10 days please assume on this occasion you have not advanced to interviewThank you for considering the role and reading until this point If youre on the fence about applying please doBest of luck and I look forward to hearing from youEdward,2023-07-21,Anywhere,2023-07-21 06:27:30.163037
