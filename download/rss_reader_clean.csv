SegMetrics: Full-Stack Developer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/segmetrics-full-stack-developer-1,"About UsSegMetrics is a marketing analytics platform that’s focused on making marketing optimization a snap for digital marketers — now with 85% fewer pivot tables.We’re a lean team of developers who are excited about data analytics and crunching numbers in new and interesting ways. While SegMetrics is a mature product, we’re always building new blue-sky features and products, which creates a lot of opportunities for building new, cool stuff.We’re passionate about enabling digital marketers to better understand their leads, and more easily optimize their marketing funnels. We believe that marketers should have the best tools at their fingertips, and not need a degree in advanced statistics to make actionable marketing decisions.We’re looking for an experienced, data-driven (or data-curious) full-stack developer to join us. This is a full-time, remote position with a flexible schedule, but we try to be available during main US business hours.You might be a perfect fit if you’re someone who’s into marketing analytics, building new ways of looking at, and working with, data — or you like working with large amounts of data at scale.In analytics, there are a hundred different ways to get the end result — if you’re someone who likes solving those types of puzzles, you’ll definitely fit in.About the RoleWe strive to make working at SegMetrics a unique experience where you can learn and grow in a fast-growing company. We have a team full of truly exceptional people who are fun to work with and at the top of their game. Here’s how we operate:Responsibility and EmpowermentAt SegMetrics, we appreciate, respect, and trust the expertise and judgment of our developers. We try our best to empower them to do what they think is right. We also work collaboratively. We continuously seek the right amount of structure and unity necessary to maximize productivity. Where it makes sense, we designate someone to make a call. Even though our developers are right a lot, it’s okay to make mistakes here. Exploration and calculated risks are vital to velocity and growth. We freely admit when we’re wrong. If something doesn’t go as expected, we learn, bounce back, and make corrections. You won’t be alone; others will be there to help, review, reassure, and back you up. We own our processes and collective outcomes as a team.Live Where You WantWe’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want, as long as it’s somewhere between the US Pacific and the Central European Time Zone. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.No Crazy HoursWe want everyone to have a full life outside of SegMetrics. We seldom work more than 40 hours per week. There have been rare occasions where things got a little crazy, and people logged some extra hours. But then they took additional time off to balance it all out. We work hard and smart, but we’re in this for the long haul; there’s no need to go crazy on the hours. We focus on what we get done, not how long we can sit in a chair.You, Our New Full Stack Developer(that leans towards the backend)You’re a Full Stack developer with at least three years of experience building, shipping, monitoring, and maintaining Laravel SaaS apps at scale (not just websites).

We do not expect “butts in seats” but are focused on consistently completing objectives & shipping solid code.You probably aren’t the one we’re looking for if:You need to be told what to work on next (No shame on this. Just not the role we’re looking for)You aren’t responsive through asynchronous communication channels like Slack or don’t work well with project managers or deadlinesYou don’t go out looking for problems to solveYou can’t build out a feature plan from a customer requestYou are anti-marketing / feel that pixel tracking is an abomination for the web (We don’t disagree, but it helps to not hold our customers in contempt)It’s also helpful to have better design sense than a drunk hamster.

Growth Tools: Mastermind Community Director,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/growth-tools-mastermind-community-director-1,"We are looking for a Mastermind Director who would love the chance to create from scratch the best online and in-person mastermind group of digital entrepreneurs that exists online. We are a coaching company and do a really good job at that. However, only having a 1:1 coach isn't enough. It's like being single parented and having no friends. It's both a TON of work for the parent and limiting for our clients. That's why we need you. Our clients need legitimate support from their peers (Hello Mastermind!) just as much as they need an amazing coach to be in their corner. We believe that humans are underrated, that we are created in the image of God. And when we turn our ideas into legit products that help people, the world is a better place and the kingdom expands. That's why our mission is making it nearly impossible to fail for our clients to get customers.This allows our clients to have more impact, make really cool stuff, and not have to spend every waking hour worrying about revenue. We need you. Yesterday.This role is a top priority in the company. Why?Because we have over 100 clients eagerly anticipating the launch of our peer-led mastermind groups, but we have no one on our team to recruit the leaders, train them, and roll it out. And without growing and thriving peer groups, our clients aren't reaching their potential. We need to add a legit Mastermind Director to our team to help us do this. We've been coaching companies and solopreneurs in marketing for 10 years. Along the way, we've discovered several new innovative and extremely effective methodologies.So if the idea of creating a thriving peer support group for CMOs, founders, and aspiring entrepreneurs of some of the most impactful, innovative, and fun companies in the world sounds exciting—keep reading. :)This role is important because, without you, we will not have the capacity to expand our coaching program and reach more clients. We need you to help us change the world one client at a time.What will you learn in this role?If you come from a ministry background, perhaps as a small group pastor, but have disliked the toxic culture, low pay, or lack of open-mindedness and innovation, you'll love this role.If you have been running your own business, but are tired of doing everything yourself and working alone, and you crave a healthy team on an exciting mission, you'll love this role.However, if you prefer highly defined day-to-day duties, don't really enjoy figuring things out, and trying new processes seems intimidating, you won't do well in this role.There is 0 red tape at Growth Tools. We don't care about how other people have always done things, how you have always done things, or what anyone's SOP is. What we care about is: 1) you love what you do every day and wake up excited to do it; and 2) our clients' success.We ruthlessly measure both on a daily basis.In this role you will learn:1. How to recruit and train small group peer leaders2. How to create small peer-led mastermind groups that thrive with genuine relationship and connection3. How to host live hot seats and work-a-long sessions for clients4. How to get highly influential business leaders and influencers to do Q&As with our clients In your role as Mastermind Director, you will own 2 numbers: 1. % of clients engaged each week 2. NPS score of the mastermindYou'll walk away from your time at Growth Tools having been an influential voice in creating and scaling one of the most innovative online education and coaching products that exists.This role will have been a success if you say: ""That was the best team I've ever been a part of and the product we created is a high watermark of my career!""Who will you work with?You will report directly to Bryan Harris, our founder and Chief Product Officer.The product team is a small team of 10 employees and the fastest growing division in the company. It is made up of both the coaching team and the software engineering team.We are a different kind of company. Our team is close knit, collaborative, competitive, and we maniacally give shout outs when we catch each other doing good things! (We even deliver cakes weekly to celebrate, too.)It's possible to do work you love!Where will you work?We work remote and have for 10 years! We all work remotely and are scattered around North America from Vancouver to Cleveland, and Nashville to Birmingham. That means you have the flexibility to work from home or a coworking location.What does Growth Tools do and why?Growth Tools provides the tools and training to help online businesses once and for all solve the problem of getting more clients. We work primarily with teaching based businesses (course creators, influencers, coaches, etc.) to help them significantly grow their revenue and impact—including getting them on the INC. 5000 list. Our tools consist of 10 SaaS products that we give away for free. Our training consists of a 1:1 coaching business, Growth University.We believe that humans are underrated and that we drastically underestimate what we're capable of. While much of the news and social media is focused on the negative, we have seen firsthand what a hope-filled entrepreneur is capable of and how much good they can do! At Growth Tools, our job is to help every client grow their business so more people can be helped and more good is done.Example:One of our clients, Chaitra Rahhakrishna, runs a small design studio. She works with e-commerce companies and helps them create beautiful websites that showcase and sell their products.When we first started working with her, she had $0 revenue and had just given birth to her first child. 12 months later, while being an awesome mom, she also grew her studio to $100,000.

"Skynova Inc: UX / UI / Visual Designer (ca EUR 70,000 / year)",https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/skynova-inc-ux-ui-visual-designer-ca-eur-70-000-year,"Time zones: SBT (UTC +11),  GMT (UTC +0),  CET (UTC +1),  EET (UTC +2),  MSK (UTC +3)Skynova has 60,000 happy customers, is bootstrapped and debt free! What a joy these days :-) Skynova (https://www.skynova.com) provides online invoicing, accounting and 30+ other business modules to self-employed and small businesses. Our main focus is the US, but we have customers from around 100 countries. Our customers are very happy: The service is easy to use and they get a good selection of tools that they can combine to fit their specific needs - all at a very competitive price point. We were founded more than 10 years ago, but we think this is just the beginning! We have a long list of new modules to create, modules to improve, core systems to refactor, experiments to run, data crunching and page loads to speed up and more. The more we work on this, the more we think of - and our customers have some ideas as well :-) To step up our efforts, we are now looking for UI/UX/Visual Designer to work on all of the above! This is a fully remote position, so autonomy and independence would be required. We collaborate using uxpin, git, jira, e-mail, google meet and more. In addition you’ll be invited to occasional meet-ups at the office in Oslo, Norway.There are in total 14 people working here, four in the US and ten in Europe.As a Senior UI/UX you’ll be working directly with the person who previously did the wireframes as well as product managers, the technical team and others in the company - depending on what needs to be done. Your personal desire should be to strive for simplicity. We try to make the UI easy and intuitive to understand, and subscribe to Steve Krug’s “Don’t make me think” philosophy. Less is generally, but not always, more. The user is not interested in reading any documentation, help articles or contact support to figure out how things work. A non-computer literate person has to understand what to do by simply looking at it.The product development team will hand over a resource document with some background information about a new module or feature, and a requirements specification document. It will be up to you to figure out the best UI to implement this. Maybe some of the requirements cannot be met? Maybe some changes to the requirements are required? Maybe some extra research is required? You’ll use your judgement. What is the essential thing that this module or feature is trying to make possible? Understand the problem, understand the customer, and make a simple solution that fits well into our UI. You may create intermediary UX sketches, but the main result of your work are pixel perfect visual designs that are handed back to the product development group. They will give you feedback, and perhaps after some back and forth, the design is finalised in a tool called uxpin. Thereafter the developers take over. We have never had a full time designer, so we hope you’ll bring us to a new level. Main responsibilities:Figure out simple, intuitive solutions to solve complex real life problems in our UI.Iterative improvements of existing designsResearch and clarify requirements / specificationsDocument and be able articulate your design decisionsRequirements:5+ years as a UI/UX/Visual designerExperience with web/saas applicationsExcellent communication skillsExcellent English skillsExcellent writing skillsLocated in Europe (or same time zones)We offer:Stable, long-term contractFully remote (with occasional meet-ups)Interesting, diverse projectsHigh degree of independence and impactCompetitive wage: EUR 40 / hourIf you have any questions, feel free to ask about anything you want. When applying, please include both a cover letter with some details about your design/ux philosophy, a resume/CV and perhaps a link or an attachment with some examples of your work / a portfolio. We look forward to hearing from you!",2023-06-15,Europe Only,2023-06-15 01:05:34.161159

You will be a key member of a tight-knit group of talented Engineers who are responsible for building and developing our platform, using cutting-edge technologies including Kubernetes Operators and Cluster API.Giant Swarm is a fast-growing open-source infrastructure management platform used by modern enterprises. Our vision is to empower developers around the world to ship great products.You will be responsible for architecting and building distributed systems, as part of our managed Kubernetes offering.You will use a wide variety of open source technologies and tools from across the open-source community, including Kubernetes, Cluster API, and Prometheus.You take part in on call, as part of our ‘you build it, you run it’ philosophy.

If you are as well - or just love giving talks - that will be a perfect addition.About usEvery new team member changes the team.

Our teams are cross- functional and collaboration is key. Nothing crazy, but useful Basics: We don't count holidays but set a minimum number; You choose your own hard- and software; As a company that has almost, if not more, kids than employees, family-friendliness is crucial to us  and paid parental leave is a no-brainer; We pay monthly perks that cover your costs for working remotely; We meet twice a year as an entire company and (if possible) see conferences as an important place to catch up with team members; We aim to be fully transparent (finance, salaries) unless it hurts people and trust you, based on this to make the best decisionsWe failed in exactly describing our way to approach important company elements that can be described with ‘buzzwords’ such as agile mindset, cross-functional teams, self-organization, value of the individual or trust & teamwork.

We developed a product to meet our needs, and in the last four years we have gone from 100k to about 4.5M in sales, with virtually no marketing. Our customers range from Fortune 500 companies to freelancers and are primarily located in North America and Northern Europe. The overwhelming majority of conversions occur in self-service mode, without any sales intervention, and our churn rate is very low (< 1%). We experienced organic growth, except for a few small (and poorly measured) experiments with SEO-optimized content, ads, and collaborations with content creators.Despite our success, we now face increased competition, and want to understand our customers better, build a stronger brand, position our product better, and engage in marketing activities to attract the right customers.We need someone who can help us decide on the best marketing tactics, execute, and monitor them. Your primary goal will be to create valuable content and experiences for our audience.Here are some of the current challenges we’ll need your help with:People who could benefit from our tool the most sometimes don’t find us in their research, and end up settling for a less appropriate product, which is a real shame.We continue to add value to the product, but we hardly tell anyone about it. 😞We’re so bad at tooting our own horns.Our positioning needs to be tightened up, and could be communicated better.By doing very little marketing we’ve left a lot of money on the table. With your help, we’d like to pick some of that up 🙂Not to grow faster, but to ensure our longevity.You will know if you’re doing a good job if we make progress on all of the above. A lot of it is not measurable, but that’s ok with us.Hiring processWe are a small company, so we rarely hire. Maybe only once or twice a year. We expect it will take a while to find the right candidate, so we have no deadline for closing this application.We will read your application, discuss it, and give you a response within 3 weeks (likely less). If we think you might be a good fit for this role, we will ask you to meet us for a video chat to get to know each other better, and discuss next steps.Here are some of the basics elements of our hiring process you should expect:We give first consideration to individuals in the desired location.While we never rush, we respect your time, and try to make the process as efficient as possible.It is our goal to keep you informed of the status of your application. We may not always be able to do this right away, but we’ll let you know one way or the other.We value diversity on our team, so our decisions will be based on a variety of factors:Quality and content of the application.Previous work experience.Written responses to follow up questions.One or more video interviews with members of our team.One or two short projects.References.In some cases, we may include a small paid contract project before making a hiring decision.",2023-06-15,Anywhere in the World,2023-06-15 01:05:36.065953

Many get so overwhelmed, they end up quitting on their dream of having a photography career. That is why we create easy-to-use, time-saving software that takes the work out of running a photography business so photographers can get back to doing what they love, creating art.Pixellu was co-founded in 2010 by two wedding photographers. Faced with the challenges of long hours and endless tasks, we began asking ourselves, “How can we save valuable time, make more money, and get our lives back?” Our answer was technology. We started Pixellu with the idea that we could make money by providing an honest service that helped photographers save time and live more fulfilling lives. We believed that, by focusing on a great product and great service, we could build a business that not only does good, but also does well.  Today, we are a team of 35 team members spread across 15 countries, serving tens of thousands of photographers in over 100 countries. Our vision is for Pixellu to become the foundation of more than 1 million successful photography businesses, so that photographers can focus on doing what they love while we automate the rest of their work. We are becoming the bridge between their camera and clients — all they would need to do is upload their photos to Pixellu. We embrace the spirit of autonomous teams that are empowered to change the photography world while having a healthy work-life balance.

CSS is mostly handled by visual design.Reviewing code: We do round-robin code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing. All pull requests are reviewed by another engineer. You’ll take turns reviewing everyone else’s code and they will take turns reviewing yours.Deploying code: We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day. Deployments are automated with lots of fail-safes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possible.Maintaining code: Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions, techniques, and technologies. You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bug.Some things you won’t do:Estimating work to be done. Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quickly.Reporting progress. Work is done when it’s deployed. Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complex.Stakeholder meetings. While agile processes are all about open channels of communication we find too much can be overwhelming. We have technical product managers who work with stakeholders instead, allowing everyone else to focus on their work while getting their questions answered.As a small company with a flat management structure there are lots of opportunities for everyone to make an impact not only on our products but also on how we build them. We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools, processes, and conventions. You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like, and we would like to learn from your experience, but the degree to which you participate is up to you.Experience we’re looking forThe main thing we’re looking for is experience in full stack web application development. Specifically, we think you’ll need at least two years experience working on all parts of a database-centric web application to be a productive member of your team. In particular you should have experience with:Relational database concepts such as: foreign keys, indexes, normalization and denormalization, SQL queries.Writing Ruby code in an MVC web framework. We don’t use Rails but we follow many of the same conventions. We’ve had success bringing people on from Python/Django so if you have Python experience and would like to learn Ruby it might be a good fit.Some familiarity with Javascript. We push as much behavior as possible to the server but features often do have small client-side components.Writing tests. We practice integration-test-heavy outside-in test-driven development. If you’ve practiced any sort of test-driven development you will pick it up fast.In addition to being able to get things done we are also looking for someone who can research and implement best practices in order to get things done well. Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad. We collaborate frequently and we don’t always get things right on the first try, but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things well to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their team.Technologies we useOpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database. Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets. At present we have plenty of room to scale.Our server-side code is MVC-structured and built on Sequel (ORM), Sinatra, and HAML. If you’re familiar with Rails (or similar MVC frameworks) you’ll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions here.On the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience, most of which ultimately requests updates from the server.There are currently around 2500 full-stack browser-based integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output. CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutes.We do things typical of web applications like:Store data in, and query from, a relational database (PostgreSQL)Index data and query it with filtering and full text searching (Elasticsearch)Handle slow tasks with background processingPush asynchronous updates to clients with WebSocketsExport XML files, PDFs, CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, and other formats that just won’t seem to go awayImport data from Excel spreadsheets, (music-industry standard) DDEX XML, JSON, and various other sourcesCommunicate with lots of external systems across all manner of bespoke APIsProvide JSON APIs for our customers to build on top ofUse git for version control, build features in branches, and take turns reviewing pull requestsRun everything on cloud infrastructureRely on service providers for devops as much as possible (Heroku, etc)Some benefits of working at OpenPlayStarting salary 100-155k depending on experienceMedical, dental, and vision insuranceWhatever tools, services, books, etc you need to do your jobLow stress environment: The industry we’re in is comparatively low scale and high value. While we work with lots of data we avoid some of the technical issues and constant urgency you might find with consumer applications.Good work/life balance: We expect that everyone works full time (40 hours/week). We do sometimes have deadlines and we haven’t always limited scope appropriately. The last time we worked late nights was in 2019 for about a week. The time before that was in 2016 for about 3 weeks. Our most recent deadline we met two weeks early.Flexible work and vacation schedule. You are free to work the hours that work best for you (outside of our scheduled meetings) and we don’t have a set limit on vacation days.Free to work remote. We’ve been doing remote work as long as we’ve been around and our process is built around it. Some of our team is permanently remote, others work out of the office part time.Office near the beach in Santa Monica you can use any time.Free lunch at nearby restaurants when you’re in the office. Some of which are delicious.How to applySend us your resume! Include a cover letter to add additional details and context if you feel so inclined. We’re mostly looking for two things:Prior work experience that looks like it might be a good match for what you’ll be doing at OpenPlay.Some understanding of how to program well. Maybe a computer science degree or other academic background. Code contributions you can point to. Blog articles you wrote. A particularly enlightening reddit comment.We’d love to know a bit about you as well but it can be a challenging prospect for an initial job application. Feel free to include anything else you’d like, but don’t worry too much about it, we’re mostly looking for the above qualifications at this point.We look forward to hearing from you, good luck on your job search wherever it leads, and thank  you for considering joining OpenPlay!",2023-06-15,USA Only,2023-06-15 01:05:56.704551
Nagarro Digital Ventures: Senior Digital Project Manager,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/nagarro-digital-ventures-senior-digital-project-manager,"Time zones: EST (UTC -5),  CST (UTC -6),  MST (UTC -7),  PST (UTC -8),  AKST (UTC -9),  HST (UTC -10),  AST (UTC -4),  NST (UTC -3:30)👋🏼 We're Nagarro Digital Ventures. We are a Digital Product Engineering consultancy who build products, services, and experiences— across all devices and digital mediums that inspire, excite, and delight. Our staff are located all around the world (9600+ experts across 26 countries, to be exact). We're looking for full-time, experienced Project Managers to help us organize and execute our client’s projects. What do we mean by Project Manager?Anyone who spent time in the industry knows the definitions of this kind of role can be pretty fluid from company to company. Our definition of the role is relatively expansive and successful Project Manager at Nagarro Digital Ventures would have the following characteristics and qualities:Good with clients: you’ll have supporting roles to help you manage the broader client relationship, but you are the day to day point person that maintains client confidence.Self-directed: remote work requires self-direction, of course, but you are also the CEO of the project, you work with the client and your team to find and define the best way to execute the project.Collaborative: while you may be the “CEO” of the project, that doesn’t mean you are a dictator. We hire competent people, value their areas of focus and expertise, and work together to accomplish the task at hand.Competent with Technology: you don’t need to be a software engineer/designer, but you need to be able to talk with software engineers/designers and understand the broad strokes of what they are doing on a given projectDesire to learn: we often help clients develop new products in a wide variety of spaces with varying levels of expertise. No one person can be expected to be an expert in every field, so you need to be flexible and willing to learn to meet client’s needs.Ability to ask for help: even the most competent people occasionally find themselves over their head, either lacking the expertise or enough time to juggle the work. Transparency with both the client and internal executive stakeholders is valued; elevate problems you can’t solve yourself early to the right people.What does the day-to-day work look like?Much of you day-to-day is defined by the clients and the projects you have. Often you are empowered to use the tools you prefer because no one tool is right for every job, though sometimes clients require specific tools that better integrate with their systems. This means skill requirements and responsibilities are a little fuzzy, but would include at least the following:Organize projects with tools like Jira, Trello, and Slack.Organize and run client and internal project meetings.Estimate new potential projects and define Scopes of Work with help from biz dev, engineering, and design.Drive on-time, on-budget delivery of Scope of Work.Resolve issues and conflicts and assess dependencies and risks of the SOW.Manage forecasting, time sheets, and billing efforts (with our accounting team) on your projects.Provide internal and external project updates for clients and internal executive management.Occasional travel for in-person client meetings (0-10% of your time), once we are comfortably past the pandemic.What are the requirements to be considered for this position?Our requirements are as flexible as our projects can be, there is no bullet proof plan or perfect list of credentials or skills, but the following would put you in strong contention for the position:Experience in the technology industry.Experience with Agile Software Development processes: running scrums and creating sprint plans. Project Management credentials are a bonus, but not required.Experience interacting with clients and finding ways to meet their needs.Experience leading teams and launching products.Experience assessing risk, conflicts, and dependencies on a project.Availability during normal North American business hours. What are the benefits Nagarro Digital Ventures Provides?Our benefits include:Competitive salary, commensurate with experienceOpen Paid Time OffParental Leave, family-friendly flexibility, and good work life balanceCompetitive healthcare benefits including health, dental, and visionWork from homeEqual OpportunityNagarro Digital Ventures is an equal opportunity employer. We are an international team that celebrates diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.",2023-06-15,North America Only,2023-06-15 01:05:57.092466
A.Team: Senior Independent Product Manager/Product Designer ($110-$190/hr),https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/a-team-senior-independent-product-manager-product-designer-110-190-hr,"A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Product Managers & Product Designers (along with developers & UX/UI folks) to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.As part of A·Team, you can expect:High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.Work alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.Full autonomy: say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on top of your rate.How to apply:Go here: https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack + mention WWR under how you heard about A·Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.What you’ll do:Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. Who A·Team is for:Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.Who A·Team is not for:People looking for small gigs.Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).Our long-term vision:A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them ""unhirables"": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.",2023-06-15,Anywhere in the World,2023-06-15 01:05:57.501506
