OpenPlay you will be collaborating with a team of 46 other engineers and a UXvisual designer to design build review deploy maintain and iterate on OpenPlays web applications We follow a minimal agile process focused on rapid deployment and incremental improvement Engineers participate in a weekly planning meeting a daily engineering meeting choose what to work on and then spend the rest of their time getting their work done collaborating as neededYou will share the same responsibilities as the rest of your engineering team which includeParticipating in a weekly planning meeting where we review our goals and prioritize work to be done for the coming weekParticipating in daily engineeringonly meetings roughly 30min where the team collaborates on technical decisions resolving issues and reducing complexityWriting tests we write mostly fullstack integration tests and use a single testing framework for all parts of the codeWriting application code mostly Ruby some HTML some Javascript CSS is mostly handled by visual designReviewing code We do roundrobin code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing All pull requests are reviewed by another engineer Youll take turns reviewing everyone elses code and they will take turns reviewing yoursDeploying code We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day Deployments are automated with lots of failsafes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possibleMaintaining code Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions techniques and technologies You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bugSome things you wont doEstimating work to be done Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quicklyReporting progress Work is done when its deployed Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complexStakeholder meetings While agile processes are all about open channels of communication we find too much can be overwhelming We have technical product managers who work with stakeholders instead allowing everyone else to focus on their work while getting their questions answeredAs a small company with a flat management structure there are lots of opportunities for everyone to make an impact not only on our products but also on how we build them We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools processes and conventions You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like and we would like to learn from your experience but the degree to which you participate is up to youExperience were looking forThe main thing were looking for is experience in full stack web application development Specifically we think youll need at least two years experience working on all parts of a databasecentric web application to be a productive member of your team In particular you should have experience withRelational database concepts such as foreign keys indexes normalization and denormalization SQL queriesWriting Ruby code in an MVC web framework We dont use Rails but we follow many of the same conventions Weve had success bringing people on from PythonDjango so if you have Python experience and would like to learn Ruby it might be a good fitSome familiarity with Javascript We push as much behavior as possible to the server but features often do have small clientside componentsWriting tests We practice integrationtestheavy outsidein testdriven development If youve practiced any sort of testdriven development you will pick it up fastIn addition to being able to get things done we are also looking for someone who can research and implement best practices in order to get things done well Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad We collaborate frequently and we dont always get things right on the first try but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things well to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their teamTechnologies we useOpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets At present we have plenty of room to scaleOur serverside code is MVCstructured and built on Sequel ORM Sinatra and HAML If youre familiar with Rails or similar MVC frameworks youll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions hereOn the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience most of which ultimately requests updates from the serverThere are currently around 2500 fullstack browserbased integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutesWe do things typical of web applications likeStore data in and query from a relational database PostgreSQLIndex data and query it with filtering and full text searching ElasticsearchHandle slow tasks with background processingPush asynchronous updates
