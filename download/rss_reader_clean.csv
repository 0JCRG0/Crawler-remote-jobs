everyone elses code and they will take turns reviewing yoursDeploying code We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day Deployments are automated with lots of failsafes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possibleMaintaining code Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions techniques and technologies You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bugSome things you wont doEstimating work to be done Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quicklyReporting progress Work is done when its deployed Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complexStakeholder meetings While agile processes are

them We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools processes and conventions You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like and

to get things done well Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad We collaborate frequently and we dont always get things right on the first try but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things well to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their teamTechnologies we useOpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets At present we have plenty of room to scaleOur serverside code is MVCstructured and built on Sequel ORM Sinatra and HAML If youre familiar with Rails or similar MVC frameworks youll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions hereOn the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience most of which ultimately requests updates from the serverThere are currently around 2500 fullstack browserbased integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutesWe do things typical of web applications likeStore
