<li style=""all:revert;"">The expected salary range for this position is $375k - $450k</li> <p style=""all:revert;""><strong style=""all:revert;"">Additional Information</strong></p> <p style=""all:revert;""></p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><span>Compensation and Benefits*</span></p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">Anthropic‚Äôs compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><b style=""all:revert;"">Equity</b> -On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><b style=""all:revert;"">Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:</p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">- Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">- Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</p>

<p style=""all:revert;"">- Fertility benefits via Carrot.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">- Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">- Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><i style=""all:revert;"">* This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic‚Äôs good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><span>How we're different</span></p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact ‚Äî advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI ‚Äî rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/#papers"" class=""postings-link"">recent research</a>. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165"" class=""postings-link"">GPT-3</a>, <a href=""https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/"" class=""postings-link"">Circuit-Based Interpretability</a>, <a href=""https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/"" class=""postings-link"">Multimodal Neurons</a>, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14701"" class=""postings-link"">Scaling Laws</a>, <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/"" class=""postings-link"">AI &amp; Compute</a>, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"" class=""postings-link"">Concrete Problems in AI Safety</a>, and <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741"" class=""postings-link"">Learning from Human Preferences</a>.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><span>Logistics</span></p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><b style=""all:revert;"">Company-wide hybrid policy: </b>Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. However, different roles may have different requirements - if this role has a different preference, it will be noted above.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><b style=""all:revert;"">Deadline to apply</b>: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;""><b style=""all:revert;"">We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.</p>
<p style=""all:revert;"">Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. </p>

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees=happy customers=happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.--Is this a real job ad?--Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it‚Äôs not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we‚Äôre big time, people.Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we‚Äôre a pretty big deal):http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/And check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it‚Äôs not just the founder‚Äôs mother who says we‚Äôre cool.--What do you guys do?--We sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches.¬†A small sampling:- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)Our business is growing rapidly every year, and it‚Äôs our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.--What is your company like?--1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don‚Äôt care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we‚Äôre happy campers.2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you‚Äôre routinely working more than 45ish hours, you‚Äôre gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.3. You Can Be Yourself. You don‚Äôt have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your credentials are ‚Äì it matters what you get done.5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.6. No Micro-Management. Once you‚Äôre trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren‚Äôt the place for you.7. Supportive Environment. We don‚Äôt operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful ‚Äì internal politics are at a minimum here.8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?9. We‚Äôll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly.

Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What‚Äôs Right for Us. We don‚Äôt have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.--What are your company‚Äôs values?--See here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it‚Äôs not just normal corporate BS. We promise you‚Äôll learn a lot about us.--OK, so I‚Äôve read like 8 dang pages about you guys.

Other than that, we will train you for everything else. This is a junior position, so we don‚Äôt expect you to create wonders.

I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.Once you‚Äôre in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don‚Äôt want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!----JLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Growth Tools: Mastermind Community Director,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/growth-tools-mastermind-community-director-1,"We are looking for a Mastermind Director who would love the chance to create from scratch the best online and in-person mastermind group of digital entrepreneurs that exists online. We are a coaching company and do a really good job at that. However, only having a 1:1 coach isn't enough. It's like being single parented and having no friends. It's both a TON of work for the parent and limiting for our clients. That's why we need you. Our clients need legitimate support from their peers (Hello Mastermind!) just as much as they need an amazing coach to be in their corner. We believe that humans are underrated, that we are created in the image of God. And when we turn our ideas into legit products that help people, the world is a better place and the kingdom expands. That's why our mission is making it nearly impossible to fail for our clients to get customers.This allows our clients to have more impact, make really cool stuff, and not have to spend every waking hour worrying about revenue. We need you. Yesterday.This role is a top priority in the company. Why?Because we have over 100 clients eagerly anticipating the launch of our peer-led mastermind groups, but we have no one on our team to recruit the leaders, train them, and roll it out. And without growing and thriving peer groups, our clients aren't reaching their potential. We need to add a legit Mastermind Director to our team to help us do this. We've been coaching companies and solopreneurs in marketing for 10 years. Along the way, we've discovered several new innovative and extremely effective methodologies.So if the idea of creating a thriving peer support group for CMOs, founders, and aspiring entrepreneurs of some of the most impactful, innovative, and fun companies in the world sounds exciting‚Äîkeep reading. :)This role is important because, without you, we will not have the capacity to expand our coaching program and reach more clients. We need you to help us change the world one client at a time.What will you learn in this role?If you come from a ministry background, perhaps as a small group pastor, but have disliked the toxic culture, low pay, or lack of open-mindedness and innovation, you'll love this role.If you have been running your own business, but are tired of doing everything yourself and working alone, and you crave a healthy team on an exciting mission, you'll love this role.However, if you prefer highly defined day-to-day duties, don't really enjoy figuring things out, and trying new processes seems intimidating, you won't do well in this role.There is 0 red tape at Growth Tools. We don't care about how other people have always done things, how you have always done things, or what anyone's SOP is. What we care about is: 1) you love what you do every day and wake up excited to do it; and 2) our clients' success.We ruthlessly measure both on a daily basis.In this role you will learn:1. How to recruit and train small group peer leaders2. How to create small peer-led mastermind groups that thrive with genuine relationship and connection3. How to host live hot seats and work-a-long sessions for clients4. How to get highly influential business leaders and influencers to do Q&As with our clients In your role as Mastermind Director, you will own 2 numbers: 1. % of clients engaged each week 2. NPS score of the mastermindYou'll walk away from your time at Growth Tools having been an influential voice in creating and scaling one of the most innovative online education and coaching products that exists.This role will have been a success if you say: ""That was the best team I've ever been a part of and the product we created is a high watermark of my career!""Who will you work with?You will report directly to Bryan Harris, our founder and Chief Product Officer.The product team is a small team of 10 employees and the fastest growing division in the company. It is made up of both the coaching team and the software engineering team.We are a different kind of company. Our team is close knit, collaborative, competitive, and we maniacally give shout outs when we catch each other doing good things! (We even deliver cakes weekly to celebrate, too.)It's possible to do work you love!Where will you work?We work remote and have for 10 years! We all work remotely and are scattered around North America from Vancouver to Cleveland, and Nashville to Birmingham. That means you have the flexibility to work from home or a coworking location.What does Growth Tools do and why?Growth Tools provides the tools and training to help online businesses once and for all solve the problem of getting more clients. We work primarily with teaching based businesses (course creators, influencers, coaches, etc.) to help them significantly grow their revenue and impact‚Äîincluding getting them on the INC. 5000 list. Our tools consist of 10 SaaS products that we give away for free. Our training consists of a 1:1 coaching business, Growth University.We believe that humans are underrated and that we drastically underestimate what we're capable of. While much of the news and social media is focused on the negative, we have seen firsthand what a hope-filled entrepreneur is capable of and how much good they can do! At Growth Tools, our job is to help every client grow their business so more people can be helped and more good is done.Example:One of our clients, Chaitra Rahhakrishna, runs a small design studio. She works with e-commerce companies and helps them create beautiful websites that showcase and sell their products.When we first started working with her, she had $0 revenue and had just given birth to her first child. 12 months later, while being an awesome mom, she also grew her studio to $100,000.

What a joy these days :-) Skynova (https://www.skynova.com) provides online invoicing, accounting and 30+ other business modules to self-employed and small businesses. Our main focus is the US, but we have customers from around 100 countries. Our customers are very happy: The service is easy to use and they get a good selection of tools that they can combine to fit their specific needs - all at a very competitive price point.¬†We were founded more than 10 years ago, but we think this is just the beginning! We have a long list of new modules to create, modules to improve, core systems to refactor, experiments to run, data crunching and page loads to speed up and more. The more we work on this, the more we think of - and our customers have some ideas as well :-)¬†To step up our efforts, we are now looking for UI/UX/Visual Designer to work on all of the above! This is a fully remote position, so autonomy and independence would be required. We collaborate using uxpin, git, jira, e-mail, google meet and more. In addition you‚Äôll be invited to occasional meet-ups at the office in Oslo, Norway.There are in total 14 people working here, four in the US and ten in Europe.As a Senior UI/UX you‚Äôll be working directly with the person who previously did the wireframes as well as product managers, the technical team and others in the company - depending on what needs to be done.¬†Your personal desire should be to strive for simplicity. We try to make the UI easy and intuitive to understand, and subscribe to Steve Krug‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me think‚Äù philosophy. Less is generally, but not always, more. The user is not interested in reading any documentation, help articles or contact support to figure out how things work. A non-computer literate person has to understand what to do by simply looking at it.The product development team will hand over a resource document with some background information about a new module or feature, and a requirements specification document. It will be up to you to figure out the best UI to implement this. Maybe some of the requirements cannot be met? Maybe some changes to the requirements are required? Maybe some extra research is required? You‚Äôll use your judgement. What is the essential thing that this module or feature is trying to make possible? Understand the problem, understand the customer, and make a simple solution that fits well into our UI.¬†You may create intermediary UX sketches, but the main result of your work are pixel perfect visual designs that are handed back to the product development group. They will give you feedback, and perhaps after some back and forth, the design is finalised in a tool called uxpin. Thereafter the developers take over.¬†We have never had a full time designer, so we hope you‚Äôll bring us to a new level.¬†Main responsibilities:Figure out simple, intuitive solutions to solve complex real life problems in our UI.Iterative improvements of existing designsResearch and clarify requirements / specificationsDocument and be able articulate your design decisionsRequirements:5+ years as a UI/UX/Visual designerExperience with web/saas applicationsExcellent communication skillsExcellent English skillsExcellent writing skillsLocated in Europe (or same time zones)We offer:Stable, long-term contractFully remote (with occasional meet-ups)Interesting, diverse projectsHigh degree of independence and impactCompetitive wage: EUR 40 / hourIf you have any questions, feel free to ask about anything you want.

As the first hire in this area, you will need to set up a functional marketing flow from scratch based on clear metrics, define a strategy, and be extremely proactive and independent in your decision making.Ideally, you have already gone through this initial bootstrap phase of marketing activities in your previous work experiences. Over time, your responsibilities will include growing the marketing team by selecting top-performing individuals to cover our needs.As the lead expert in marketing, you‚Äôll define and manage specific marketing initiatives for campaigns, advertising, and our website.

We developed a product to meet our needs, and in the last four years we have gone from 100k to about 4.5M in sales, with virtually no marketing.¬†Our customers range from Fortune 500 companies to freelancers and are primarily located in North America and Northern Europe. The overwhelming majority of conversions occur in self-service mode, without any sales intervention, and our churn rate is very low (< 1%).¬†We experienced organic growth, except for a few small (and poorly measured) experiments with SEO-optimized content, ads, and collaborations with content creators.Despite our success, we now face increased competition, and want to understand our customers better, build a stronger brand, position our product better, and engage in marketing activities to attract the right customers.We need someone who can help us decide on the best marketing tactics, execute, and monitor them. Your primary goal will be to create valuable content and experiences for our audience.Here are some of the current challenges we‚Äôll need your help with:People who could benefit from our tool the most sometimes don‚Äôt find us in their research, and end up settling for a less appropriate product, which is a real shame.We continue to add value to the product, but we hardly tell anyone about it. üòûWe‚Äôre so bad at tooting our own horns.Our positioning needs to be tightened up, and could be communicated better.By doing very little marketing we‚Äôve left a lot of money on the table. With your help, we‚Äôd like to pick some of that up üôÇNot to grow faster, but to ensure our longevity.You will know if you‚Äôre doing a good job if we make progress on all of the above. A lot of it is not measurable, but that‚Äôs ok with us.Hiring processWe are a small company, so we rarely hire. Maybe only once or twice a year. We expect it will take a while to find the right candidate, so we have no deadline for closing this application.We will read your application, discuss it, and give you a response within 3 weeks (likely less). If we think you might be a good fit for this role, we will ask you to meet us for a video chat to get to know each other better, and discuss next steps.Here are some of the basics elements of our hiring process you should expect:We give first consideration to individuals in the desired location.While we never rush, we respect your time, and try to make the process as efficient as possible.It is our goal to keep you informed of the status of your application. We may not always be able to do this right away, but we‚Äôll let you know one way or the other.We value diversity on our team, so our decisions will be based on a variety of factors:Quality and content of the application.Previous work experience.Written responses to follow up questions.One or more video interviews with members of our team.One or two short projects.References.In some cases, we may include a small paid contract project before making a hiring decision.",2023-06-16,Anywhere in the World,2023-06-16 12:54:22.780688

Faced with the challenges of long hours and endless tasks, we began asking ourselves, ‚ÄúHow can we save valuable time, make more money, and get our lives back?‚Äù Our answer was technology. We started Pixellu with the idea that we could make money by providing an honest service that helped photographers save time and live more fulfilling lives. We believed that, by focusing on a great product and great service, we could build a business that not only does good, but also does well. ¬†Today, we are a team of 35 team members spread across 15 countries, serving tens of thousands of photographers in over 100 countries.

You‚Äôll work with us to architect, build, deploy, and maintain applications used by the world‚Äôs largest record companies (and some of the world‚Äôs smallest). This is a full-time position that can be in our office (Los Angeles/Santa Monica) or fully remote (US only at this time). We are looking for engineers with two or more years of full stack web application development experience. Starting salary range is 100-150k depending on experience. Learn more about OpenPlay at: www.openplay.coEngineering at OpenPlayThousands of record labels around the world use our flagship product OpenPlay Music to manage and distribute their music. We work with the major US record distributors and many independents. We are onboarding another 300+ record labels this year and we need to grow our engineering team to handle increasing demand for both client services and new product growth. OpenPlay is a bootstrapped, growing company started in 2013.In your role at OpenPlay you will be collaborating with a team of 4-6 other engineers and a UX/visual designer to design, build, review, deploy, maintain, and iterate on OpenPlay‚Äôs web applications. We follow a minimal agile process focused on rapid deployment and incremental improvement. Engineers participate in a weekly planning meeting, a daily engineering meeting, choose what to work on, and then spend the rest of their time getting their work done, collaborating as needed.You will share the same responsibilities as the rest of your engineering team, which include:Participating in a weekly planning meeting where we review our goals and prioritize work to be done for the coming week.Participating in daily engineering-only meetings (roughly 30min) where the team collaborates on technical decisions, resolving issues, and reducing complexity.Writing tests: we write mostly full-stack integration tests and use a single testing framework for all parts of the code.Writing application code: mostly Ruby, some HTML, some Javascript. CSS is mostly handled by visual design.Reviewing code: We do round-robin code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing. All pull requests are reviewed by another engineer. You‚Äôll take turns reviewing everyone else‚Äôs code and they will take turns reviewing yours.Deploying code: We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day. Deployments are automated with lots of fail-safes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possible.Maintaining code: Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions, techniques, and technologies. You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bug.Some things you won‚Äôt do:Estimating work to be done. Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quickly.Reporting progress. Work is done when it‚Äôs deployed. Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complex.Stakeholder meetings. While agile processes are all about open channels of communication we find too much can be overwhelming. We have technical product managers who work with stakeholders instead, allowing everyone else to focus on their work while getting their questions answered.As a small company with a flat management structure there are lots of opportunities for everyone to make an impact not only on our products but also on how we build them. We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools, processes, and conventions. You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like, and we would like to learn from your experience, but the degree to which you participate is up to you.Experience we‚Äôre looking forThe main thing we‚Äôre looking for is experience in full stack web application development. Specifically, we think you‚Äôll need at least two years experience working on all parts of a database-centric web application to be a productive member of your team. In particular you should have experience with:Relational database concepts such as: foreign keys, indexes, normalization and denormalization, SQL queries.Writing Ruby code in an MVC web framework. We don‚Äôt use Rails but we follow many of the same conventions. We‚Äôve had success bringing people on from Python/Django so if you have Python experience and would like to learn Ruby it might be a good fit.Some familiarity with Javascript. We push as much behavior as possible to the server but features often do have small client-side components.Writing tests. We practice integration-test-heavy outside-in test-driven development. If you‚Äôve practiced any sort of test-driven development you will pick it up fast.In addition to being able to get things done we are also looking for someone who can research and implement best practices in order to get things done well. Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad. We collaborate frequently and we don‚Äôt always get things right on the first try, but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things well to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their team.Technologies we useOpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database. Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets. At present we have plenty of room to scale.Our server-side code is MVC-structured and built on Sequel (ORM), Sinatra, and HAML. If you‚Äôre familiar with Rails (or similar MVC frameworks) you‚Äôll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions here.On the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience, most of which ultimately requests updates from the server.There are currently around 2500 full-stack browser-based integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output. CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutes.We do things typical of web applications like:Store data in, and query from, a relational database (PostgreSQL)Index data and query it with filtering and full text searching (Elasticsearch)Handle slow tasks with background processingPush asynchronous updates to clients with WebSocketsExport XML files, PDFs, CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, and other formats that just won‚Äôt seem to go awayImport data from Excel spreadsheets, (music-industry standard) DDEX XML, JSON, and various other sourcesCommunicate with lots of external systems across all manner of bespoke APIsProvide JSON APIs for our customers to build on top ofUse git for version control, build features in branches, and take turns reviewing pull requestsRun everything on cloud infrastructureRely on service providers for devops as much as possible (Heroku, etc)Some benefits of working at OpenPlayStarting salary 100-155k depending on experienceMedical, dental, and vision insuranceWhatever tools, services, books, etc you need to do your jobLow stress environment: The industry we‚Äôre in is comparatively low scale and high value. While we work with lots of data we avoid some of the technical issues and constant urgency you might find with consumer applications.Good work/life balance: We expect that everyone works full time (40 hours/week). We do sometimes have deadlines and we haven‚Äôt always limited scope appropriately. The last time we worked late nights was in 2019 for about a week. The time before that was in 2016 for about 3 weeks. Our most recent deadline we met two weeks early.Flexible work and vacation schedule. You are free to work the hours that work best for you (outside of our scheduled meetings) and we don‚Äôt have a set limit on vacation days.Free to work remote. We‚Äôve been doing remote work as long as we‚Äôve been around and our process is built around it. Some of our team is permanently remote, others work out of the office part time.Office near the beach in Santa Monica you can use any time.Free lunch at nearby restaurants when you‚Äôre in the office. Some of which are delicious.How to applySend us your resume! Include a cover letter to add additional details and context if you feel so inclined.

Nagarro Digital Ventures: Senior Digital Project Manager,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/nagarro-digital-ventures-senior-digital-project-manager,"Time zones: EST (UTC -5),  CST (UTC -6),  MST (UTC -7),  PST (UTC -8),  AKST (UTC -9),  HST (UTC -10),  AST (UTC -4),  NST (UTC -3:30)üëãüèº We're Nagarro Digital Ventures.¬†We are a Digital Product Engineering consultancy who build products, services, and experiences‚Äî across all devices and digital mediums that inspire, excite, and delight. Our staff are located all around the world (9600+ experts across 26 countries, to be exact). We're looking for full-time, experienced Project Managers to help us organize and execute our client‚Äôs projects. What do we mean by Project Manager?Anyone who spent time in the industry knows the definitions of this kind of role can be pretty fluid from company to company. Our definition of the role is relatively expansive and successful Project Manager at Nagarro Digital Ventures would have the following characteristics and qualities:Good with clients: you‚Äôll have supporting roles to help you manage the broader client relationship, but you are the day to day point person that maintains client confidence.Self-directed: remote work requires self-direction, of course, but you are also the CEO of the project, you work with the client and your team to find and define the best way to execute the project.Collaborative: while you may be the ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù of the project, that doesn‚Äôt mean you are a dictator. We hire competent people, value their areas of focus and expertise, and work together to accomplish the task at hand.Competent with Technology: you don‚Äôt need to be a software engineer/designer, but you need to be able to talk with software engineers/designers and understand the broad strokes of what they are doing on a given projectDesire to learn: we often help clients develop new products in a wide variety of spaces with varying levels of expertise. No one person can be expected to be an expert in every field, so you need to be flexible and willing to learn to meet client‚Äôs needs.Ability to ask for help: even the most competent people occasionally find themselves over their head, either lacking the expertise or enough time to juggle the work. Transparency with both the client and internal executive stakeholders is valued; elevate problems you can‚Äôt solve yourself early to the right people.What does the day-to-day work look like?Much of you day-to-day is defined by the clients and the projects you have. Often you are empowered to use the tools you prefer because no one tool is right for every job, though sometimes clients require specific tools that better integrate with their systems. This means skill requirements and responsibilities are a little fuzzy, but would include at least the following:Organize projects with tools like Jira, Trello, and Slack.Organize and run client and internal project meetings.Estimate new potential projects and define Scopes of Work with help from biz dev, engineering, and design.Drive on-time, on-budget delivery of Scope of Work.Resolve issues and conflicts and assess dependencies and risks of the SOW.Manage forecasting, time sheets, and billing efforts (with our accounting team) on your projects.Provide internal and external project updates for clients and internal executive management.Occasional travel for in-person client meetings (0-10% of your time), once we are comfortably past the pandemic.What are the requirements to be considered for this position?Our requirements are as flexible as our projects can be, there is no bullet proof plan or perfect list of credentials or skills, but the following would put you in strong contention for the position:Experience in the technology industry.Experience with Agile Software Development processes: running scrums and creating sprint plans. Project Management credentials are a bonus, but not required.Experience interacting with clients and finding ways to meet their needs.Experience leading teams and launching products.Experience assessing risk, conflicts, and dependencies on a project.Availability during normal North American business hours.¬†What are the benefits Nagarro Digital Ventures Provides?Our benefits include:Competitive salary, commensurate with experienceOpen Paid Time OffParental Leave, family-friendly flexibility, and good work life balanceCompetitive healthcare benefits including health, dental, and visionWork from homeEqual OpportunityNagarro Digital Ventures is an equal opportunity employer. We are an international team that celebrates diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.",2023-06-16,North America Only,2023-06-16 12:54:40.772593

A¬∑Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A¬∑Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.As part of A¬∑Team, you can expect:High-paying, meaningful client missions (where you'd lead Product) with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.Work alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.Full autonomy: say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A¬∑Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.¬†Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A¬∑Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on top of your rate.How to apply:Go here: https://build.a.team/wwrproductmgrfasttrack + mention WWR under how you heard about A¬∑Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there‚Äôs a fit.What you‚Äôll do:Once part of A.Team, you‚Äôll regularly be invited to be the lead Product manager/designer for impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old-school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.¬†You‚Äôll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.¬†Who A¬∑Team is for:Senior Product Managers/Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.Who A¬∑Team is not for:People looking for small gigs.Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).Our long-term vision:A¬∑Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them ""unhirables"": people who traditional companies couldn‚Äôt hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams.¬†To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.",2023-06-16,Anywhere in the World,2023-06-16 12:54:41.215911
