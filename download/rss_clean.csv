httpswwwoccrporgenoccrpjobselasticsearchconsultantDescription Application deadline 30062023 About OCCRP The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project OCCRP is a growing global nonprofit media organization that is reinventing investigative journalism for the public good By developing and equipping a global network of investigative journalists and publishing their stories we expose crime and corruption so the public can hold power to account We see a future where organized crime and corruption are drastically reduced and democracy is strengthened Our global team includes editors researchers data engineers security specialists administrators technologists and strategists each with areas of indepth expertise Aleph To support investigative journalists and member centers in their work to uncover corruption and hold power to account OCCRP developed an investigative data platform called OCCRP Aleph The platform serves as a central repository for exploring leaks datasets and and datadumps that are critical to effective investigative journalism This platform now contains over 3 billion records and has served as a cornerstone in many global groundbreaking investigations  The platform allows journalists to ingest documents and both structured and unstructured data and maps that data to an ontology that we developed called Follow the Money Users can then search across all Aleph datasets to find connections entities and crossreference entities between datasets to uncover wrongdoing and patterns This is largely possible through our use of Elasticsearch ES which is a central part of the application enabling rapid search through records  The platform that weve developed runs in a kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP Our ES cluster comprises 21 Nodes including 3 master nodes Each node uses a 2Tb SSD with 26Gb RAM and 4 vCPUs The userfacing side of Aleph is written in Python and React with a Postgres database and an accompanying suite of CLI tools The Project The Challenge Aleph has now been in use for over seven years and in that time our ES index has grown significantly The ES index is currently 30Tb and is increasing in size all the time Although this growth is a testament to the success of the platform and the popularity of it with our users it has brought with it very significant running costs As such the primary goal of this project is to investigate and optimize our current ES setup in the hope of making it more spaceefficient and cost effective and without impacting performance or usefulness of the platform for our users  Where you can help As an ElasticSearch expert you will work closely with the Aleph development team to   Audit the current ElasticSearch implementation and propose possible tweaks and other lowhangingfruit changes we could make to improve cost efficiency   Understand the current ES setup and implementation and how it is tied into Alephs core functionality  Investigate avenues for potential improvement of cost efficiency  Propose architectural changes small or large to our ES implementation or Aleph as a whole that could significantly improve cost effectiveness without compromising performance  Help us implement these changes development planning architecture when we know what they are As the expert wed expect you to make recommendations but there are several avenues that weve considered  Optimizing our existing configuration to try and reduce the size of our index  Setting up hotcold nodes within the index for less frequently accessed data where longer retrieval time is more acceptable  Refactoring the way in which data is split across indexes to allow better more efficient searches  Setting up an archive process for taking data offline and reducing the size of our index What you bring to the table  Significant experience working with elasticsearch and ideally with performance and cost optimization  Ideally experience working with an NGO  Solutionsoriented outlook and collaborative mindset to bring creative solutions to the table How to apply If youre interested in helping us with the project either as an individual or as an organization wed love to hear from you For Individuals If youre an individual interested in getting involved please email us a copy of your CV along with a cover letter detailing your interest and daily rates to jobsatoccrporg  Once were

Growth Tools Mastermind Community Director,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/growth-tools-mastermind-community-director-1,  Headquarters United States URL httpgrowthtoolscom  We are looking for a Mastermind Director who would love the chance to create from scratch the best online and inperson mastermind group of digital entrepreneurs that exists online We are a coaching company and do a really good job at that However only having a 11 coach isnt enough Its like being single parented and having no friends Its both a TON of work for the parent and limiting for our clients  Thats why we need you Our clients need legitimate support from their peers Hello Mastermind just as much as they need an amazing coach to be in their corner  We believe that humans are underrated that we are created in the image of God And when we turn our ideas into legit products that help people the world is a better place and the kingdom expands Thats why our mission is making it nearly impossible to fail for our clients to get customersThis allows our clients to have more impact make really cool stuff and not have to spend every waking hour worrying about revenue  We need you Yesterday This role is a top priority in the company Why Because we have over 100 clients eagerly anticipating the launch of our peerled mastermind groups but we have no one on our team to recruit the leaders train them and roll it out And without growing and thriving peer groups our clients arent reaching their potential  We need to add a legit Mastermind Director to our team to help us do this  Weve been coaching companies and solopreneurs in marketing for 10 years Along the way weve discovered several new innovative and extremely effective methodologies So if the idea of creating a thriving peer support group for CMOs founders and aspiring entrepreneurs of some of the most impactful innovative and fun companies in the world sounds excitingkeep reading  This role is important because without you we will not have the capacity to expand our coaching program and reach more clients We need you to help us change the world one client at a time  What will you learn in this role If you come from a ministry background perhaps as a small group pastor but have disliked the toxic culture low pay or lack of openmindedness and innovation youll love this role If you have been running your own business but are tired of doing everything yourself and working alone and you crave a healthy team on an exciting mission youll love this role However if you prefer highly defined daytoday duties dont really enjoy figuring

engineers to work with us on our suite of enterprise webbased music industry apps Youll work with us to architect build deploy and maintain applications used by the worlds largest record companies and some of the worlds smallest This is a fulltime position that can be in our office Los AngelesSanta Monica or fully remote US only at this time We are looking for engineers with two or more years of full stack web application development experience Starting salary range is 100150k depending on experience Learn more about OpenPlay at wwwopenplayco Engineering at OpenPlay Thousands of record labels around the world use our flagship product OpenPlay Music to manage and distribute their music We work with the major US record distributors and many independents We are onboarding another 300 record labels this year and we need to grow our engineering team to handle increasing demand for both client services and new product growth OpenPlay is a bootstrapped growing company started in 2013 In your role at OpenPlay you will be collaborating with a team of 46 other engineers and a UXvisual designer to design build review deploy maintain and iterate on OpenPlays web applications We follow a minimal agile process focused on rapid deployment and incremental improvement Engineers participate in a weekly planning meeting a daily engineering meeting choose what to work on and then spend the rest of their time getting their work done collaborating as needed You will share the same responsibilities as the rest of your engineering team which include Participating in a weekly planning meeting where we review our goals and prioritize work to be done for the coming week Participating in daily engineeringonly meetings roughly 30min where the team collaborates on technical decisions resolving issues and reducing complexity Writing tests we write mostly fullstack integration tests and use a single testing framework for all parts of the code Writing application code mostly Ruby some HTML some Javascript CSS is mostly handled by visual design Reviewing code We do roundrobin code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing All pull requests are reviewed by another engineer Youll take turns reviewing everyone elses code and they will take turns reviewing yours Deploying code We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day Deployments are automated with lots of failsafes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possible Maintaining code Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions techniques and technologies You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bug  Some things you wont do Estimating work to be done Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quickly Reporting progress Work is done when its deployed Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complex Stakeholder meetings While agile processes are all about open channels of communication we find too much can be overwhelming We have technical product managers who work with stakeholders instead allowing everyone else to focus on their work while getting their questions answered As a small company with a flat management structure there are lots of opportunities for everyone to make an impact not only on our products but also on how we build them We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools processes and conventions You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like and we would like to learn from your experience but the degree to which you participate is up to you Experience were looking for The main thing were looking for is experience in full stack web application development Specifically we think youll need at least two years experience working on all parts of a databasecentric web application to be a productive member of your team In particular you should have experience with Relational database concepts such as foreign keys indexes normalization and denormalization SQL queries Writing Ruby code in an MVC web framework We dont use Rails but we follow many of the same conventions Weve had success bringing people on from PythonDjango so if you have Python experience and would like to learn Ruby it might be a good fit Some familiarity with Javascript We push as much behavior as possible to the server but features often do have small clientside components Writing tests We practice integrationtestheavy outsidein testdriven development If youve practiced any sort of testdriven development you will pick it up fast In addition to being able to get things done we are also looking for someone who can research and implement best practices in order to get things done well Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad We collaborate frequently and we dont always get things right on the first try but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things well to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their team Technologies we use OpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets At present we have plenty of room to scale Our serverside code is MVCstructured and built on Sequel ORM Sinatra and HAML If youre familiar with Rails or similar MVC frameworks youll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions here On the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience most of which ultimately requests updates from the server There are currently around 2500 fullstack browserbased integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutes We do things typical of web applications like Store data in and query from a relational database PostgreSQL Index data and query it with filtering and full text searching Elasticsearch Handle slow tasks with background processing Push asynchronous updates to clients with WebSockets Export XML files PDFs CSVs Excel spreadsheets and other formats that just wont seem to go away Import data from Excel spreadsheets musicindustry standard DDEX XML JSON and various other sources Communicate with lots of external systems across all manner of bespoke APIs Provide JSON APIs for our customers to build on
