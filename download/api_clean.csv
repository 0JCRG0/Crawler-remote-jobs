Add a section on lens cleaning to the operation manual distributed to customer maintenance staff.Wednesday - Train some of the warehouse technicians about how to operate the machine on their own without supervision. One of them manages to get the system into an error state you’ve never seen. Dig into the logs and submit a detailed bug to the application team. Have dinner with the team.Thursday - Work with the engineering team to analyze the results of the last production run and implement changes to improve the robots performance. Run another production batch to confirm the fix has helped. Friday - Take a few calls to plan for next month’s deployment at a new customer.

Front End Engineer,https://remoteOK.com/remote-jobs/remote-front-end-engineer-launchbrightly-307168,At LaunchBrightly we are on a mission to automate a process that continually captures and enhances screenshots of all your SaaS product features. The continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline and process that engineers adopted over the last decade is what we ultimately want to build for customer support teams. TLDR; LaunchBrightly = CircleCI for customer support. And we are currently looking to bring onboard a strong Front-End Engineer (Vue SPA / Tailwind).Â Everyone at LaunchBrightly is a creator an owner or perhaps better a celebration of the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. Most big companies are afraid of entrusting the future of the company and their software to a few makers and as they defend against that they end up with three layers of managers and a product designed by a committee. We want the opposite. We need the opposite as we enter virgin territory trying to build that CI/CD pipeline and process for the support organization. As our customer pushes a new feature to production we automatically update all product images within the help center. This is a thrilling adventure!Our work is remote not distant. We believe that being a remote-first organization allows us to build an exceptional team composed of makers and sellers with diverse backgrounds and skill sets from around the globe. Our default work culture is asynchronous and emphasizes written communication to prioritize maker time focus and company productivity. Our goal is not to eliminate face-to-face interaction but we should default to a setting where written documentation is so strong that a meeting on most project subject matters would seem odd.Â Â Founded in 2022 and backed by prominent venture firms including IA Ventures Tuesday Capital and B Capital Group this is a unique opportunity to join this band of misfits on the ground floor. As an early teammate you will be working intimately with the founding team who has done 0 to 1 five times over while seeing four of them come to an exit.The Front-End Engineer will become an integral member of an intimate 6-person team consisting of:Maker #4 (Frontend Engineer You!)Maker #3 (Jose Frontend/Extensions Engineer)Maker #2 (Hyder Backend Engineer)Maker #1 (Dennis Founder)Seller #1 (Josh Co-founder)Helper #1 (Vibeke)However we are looking not just for an Engineer but rather a teammate we see as integral to LaunchBrightlyâs long-term journey and vital to our success. Someone who is comfortable in the dark and who sees a certain romance like we do in embracing the unknowns that come with being on the startup journey. We have a track record of seeing those colleagues who join us on the ground floor of our ventures ride the startup journey to completion (exit) with us as we grow and become successful together. This is something we take seriously and something we are extremely proud of!Â Job DescriptionYou will actively help take the current MVP to a V1 so tech savvy but non-technical knowledge managers and technical writers have a product experience they will love to use. You and Jose are the initial and primary customers of our internal Screenshotting and Styling API and your feedback is crucial to help elevate it in the mission of making our App better.Â You will help extend the initial MVP feature set and expand along the following tracks (not exhaustive and mostly illustrative):Build new interesting onboarding flows so that we make an elaborate process as easy to digest as possibleÂ Build interfaces to provide a smooth setup path to embed our live screenshots on customer destinationsBuild an easy-to-use (and near fail-proof) Syncing flow for the help center platforms we integrate withBuild and help imagine Sync Notifications emails and Dashboards which are the precursors to actual live SyncBuild Sync action pages and associated Analytics DashboardsHelp expand our Cloud Browser which makes it as easy as possible for our customers to identify an element inside their web app and tag it for automated screenshottingA large part of our success hinges on us being able to adopt many of the technical CI/CD wonders from engineering and leveraging them via non-technical user interfaces. So your job is also one of the artful craft in tuning a form button dropdown sort filter and label to the degree one would not need to on other B2B applications - and we are not shy to apply a fair amount of B2C glitter to achieve this.Â Once an image is extracted cleaned enhanced and styled it is uploaded to our CDN and our customer can use it manually from here. Weâll also offer native integrations that allow them to sync images automatically. However we assume there is a real need to allow access to the live images in different environments; a plugiextension for e.g. Zendesk to see Support folks easily reply to a ticket with a linked image is a likely path of ours.Â We are looking for previous experience working withBuilding production-level B2B Web Apps (using Jest/Vitest for unit testing)Vue 3 SPA (JS/TypeScript)Tailwind CSS (HeadlessUI)Plain vanilla CSS for the more sexy UI Elements we might implement.Â Applying a UI/UX focus to your development including UX researchConsuming and commenting on internal APIsDynamoDB GraphQLAnalytics/Event tagging for researchWhat you bring to the tableMinimum 3 years of industry experience in front-end developmentA developer who derives satisfaction from producing a genuinely useful product that improves the lives of othersA customer-first mentality with an instinct to imagine how users will react and interactStrong and precise communication and documentation skills with a will to understand and be understoodPrides themselves on writing highly readable thoroughly tested codeThe personal organization skills and patience to manage multiple contexts as projects and features come together. A good dev can do things like: juggle tickets and Git branches keep zero inbox write notes for themselves to keep their small tasks straight whip up shell scripts/test data to automate repetitive tasksA passion for being part of the startup journey and taking ownership of the companyâs successA willingness to take initiative and enthusiasm to make an impact and take actionThrives in a highly collaborative environment and enthusiasm for being a team playerBonus point if youWe use Tailwind UI but having implemented prior Design Systems and generally having a superior eye for design is a big plus.Â Built Apps on the AWS Amplify (Serverless Design) framework which is the primary backdrop for our App.Â Â What we offerFlexible working hours and locations. Your success is measured on outcomes.Â Excellent start-up culture with openness and inclusivenessTrue ownership and autonomy over your role and the impact on the companyPrioritization of focus time and productivityÂ Your choice of technical setup and equipmentExperienced founders with many years of successfully building product across multiple venturesAnnual meetup as a team in New York City. *We have our first NYC off-site from October 23-27 2023 and would love for you to join us!Dennis MortensenÂ (CEO and Founder)Josh PeacockÂ (COO and Co-founder)Please mention the word **TRUSTED** and tag RMTg3LjE5MC4yOC4yNDE= when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMTg3LjE5MC4yOC4yNDE=).

If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us donât hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com.Ahum. Here it comes.Whatâs a Silverfin?At Silverfin weâre trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS weâre automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers the business owners.The good news is weâre succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is thereâs still plenty left to work on and thatâs where we hope you come in.Whatâs the product team like?The product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers. The teams input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy. From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book Inspired by Marty Cagan.Â What does working at Silverfin look like?The product team will work together with the other Silverfin engineering teams. While the product team is set up as a stream-aligned team most other teams are set up as platform teams around modules and topics of the Silverfin application. They are helping the stream-aligned team to develop solutions fast and without a lot of mental overhead. The platform teams focus is the stability and long term architecture of the product as well as building frameworks and libraries that can be used by the stream aligned team. If those terms are not familiar to you check out the Team Topologies book by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton which inspired this structure.Â Our ops team ensures things run smoothly deploys happen correctly and will work with you when issues should arise. Weâre enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset which means ops and developers work together to solve problems and empower each-other to be self-sufficient instead of throwing problems over the wall to the âother sideâ.We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab Quip and Slack with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.Â No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban but theyâre free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB* and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs and provide third parties an API of our own.*: Our ops team noted that this actually isnât that hard to achieve if youâre just indexing everything but it still sounds impressive right?What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?Weâre a remote-first engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary and never expect anyone to work longer hours than theyâve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring and we feel thatâs exactly how it should be.Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. Itâs OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands get a haircut pick up the kids - whatever reason you donât need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load and in the rare cases itâs not we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We donât shy away from chatting in Slack but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues over email or in Quip so thereâs a written persisted record. Weâre mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slackâs DnD function especially when youâre not working!Weâd be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel but itâs not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.What does your future look like?Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you donât need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted including pay raises as a contributor just like as a manager.Everyone has a â¬1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences courses workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation travel costs. If the conference is on a workday youâll get paid like any normal day.RequirementsYou have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languagesYou get RailsYour work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)You can communicate clearly in English both written and verballyNice to havesThese would be nice but are definitely not necessary.

Senior Independent Software Developer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-independent-software-developer-814298,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.      How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-07-10,Worldwide,2023-07-10 00:16:12.849980
