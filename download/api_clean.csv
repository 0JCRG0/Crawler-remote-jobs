Director of Product,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/product/director-of-product-1710532,Are you a seasoned product leader who can drive materialization of our vision to automate treatment planning workflows using AI both in Promaton and in the larger Straumann Group organization? We are making healthcare more affordable and accessible for everyone and through our partnership we now have the potential to extend our global reach in multiple clinical domains! Promaton is a leader in automating dental treatment planning &amp; design. We’ve started our journey in 2017 and we are one of the first in the world to provide high quality dental treatment planning automation in implantology. Since 2020 we’ve partnered with Straumann Group to maximize our global reach. We’ve started by building key AI building blocks such as CBCT and optical scan segmentation and have now progressed into design &amp; treatment planning automation in three dental clinical domains (implantology restorative design and orthodontics). With a team of about 30 experts we move in a fast and agile way while we are also integrating into an increasing part of the Straumann digital portfolio. Our team is leveraging the latest innovation (e.g. in generative AI and web frontend for treatment planning in 3D) and is highly specialized in both R&amp;D and bringing new services into production. We are looking for a product leader who can function well in both our fast startup environment and in our larger partner organization. In both of these contexts there is a high motivation to innovate and deliver value to the market and there is freedom to shape a strong product organization. Today we have four product managers in Promaton who have brought the first products to market in the past years. We are now expanding our portfolio both in terms of AI automation and increasingly in delivering a more end-to-end (frontend) experience. Do you have a strong affinity with both a lean and effective startup way-of-work (e.g. with OKRs and a remote-first/async and writing-heavy culture) and an incumbent culture (strong verbal communication &amp; influence in meetings affinity with larger organizations core processes &amp; its continuous transformation)? We are looking for a person who can bridge these cultures and can translate best practices into a complex larger organization. On the product side we love solving very complex problems: we are operating in multiple highly complex clinical domains bringing products/services driven by new cutting-edge AI and web technology. You have to love eating complexity for breakfast 😄 In practice this requires a high new information intake and being able to translate complex problems into simple and clear messages. We are looking for a passionate product leader with a strong focus on empowering product managers and teams. This would require situational awareness with regards to using frameworks and best-practices to drive product on leadership strategy and management levels. This means leading our internal product organization (of currently four PMs) and coaching a much larger group of stakeholders in product management strategy and leadership (within both Promaton and Straumann Group). In practice this involves co-defining a larger portfolio and product strategy from our vision and helping our teams execute on this product strategy successfully. Key areas of responsibility   Co-define and drive product strategy and product management together with Straumann Group &amp; Promaton on the short medium and long term   Change management in Straumann to align their digital product and tech (and larger surrounding) organization on a more empowered product management way-of-work and to create alignment on a shared product vision and strategy   Internal professionalization (structuring product management and bringing in more processes &amp; best-practices) and growth of the product organization   The perks 💰 Excellent employment terms 🏡 Freedom to work from anywhere you like (and any time you like). We only have a few touch points. We are a remote company by design (not just in Covid times) and have people working from all over Europe. 👩‍🔬 Dedicated time for hackathons and research to explore new ideas of your own 🎓 Training budget for books online courses and conferences or anything else you need to grow 🚀 Work with the latest technology on the front-end of a rapidly changing field in medical 💪 Loads of responsibility and autonomy zero bureaucracy and a chance to make a real impact 🏖 Awesome yearly company retreat and quarterly team events ⛺️ 32 days of annual leave 💻 Top-notch gear 🏄‍♂️ Promaton is funded for many years to come meaning you can have the impact you only get at a startup but with the job security of an established company. 🛬 For international candidates: Promaton is recognized as a visa sponsor by the Dutch government   Minimum 5 years of experience in product management roles   Mix of startup and corporate product management experience   Strong skills on stakeholder management   Ability to work in a highly complex environment experience with AI/ML products   Product leadership experience   People-first and remote-first mindset   Bonus points   Any prior experience in a medical or regulated environment   Strong experience in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning   Sounds like you?

Senior Independent UX/UI Designer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/design/senior-independent-ux-ui-designer-986276,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.  How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-06-21,Worldwide,2023-06-21 12:52:16.865545

Senior Independent Software Developer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-independent-software-developer-814298,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.      How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-06-21,Worldwide,2023-06-21 12:52:16.867508
