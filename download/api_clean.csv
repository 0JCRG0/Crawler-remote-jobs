Senior iOS Engineer,https://echojobs.io/job/tia-senior-ios-engineer-6bzsw,Description About us:Founded in 2017 by Carolyn Witte and Felicity Yost Tia is the modern medical home for women. We are trailblazing a new paradigm for women’s healthcare that treats women as whole people vs. parts or life stages. Blending in-person and virtual care services Tia’s “Whole Woman Whole Life” care model fuses gynecology primary care mental health and evidence-based wellness services to treat women comprehensively. By making women’s health higher quality and lower cost Tia makes women healthier providers happier and the business of care delivery stronger — setting a new standard of care for women everywhere.Tia has raised more than $132 Million in venture capital funding to date including a $100 Million Series B investment one of the largest early-stage rounds ever for a healthcare company focused on women. Since launching in 2017 Tia has grown to serve thousands of women aged 18-80 with blended in-person and virtual care in New York City Los Angeles Phoenix and San Francisco. In 2023 Tia announced its most recent joint venture partner Cedars-Sinai. Tia and Cedars-Sinai plan to serve more than 100 000 women in the Los Angeles region and aim to expand access to comprehensive women’s health care in a market with primary care/GYN provider shortages.Tia is building a culture of excellence — in people process and product. This is our northstar value.What is excellence exactly?Excellence about constantly elevating yourself it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities and identifying your top potential through constant learning experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead in our terms excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We’re looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records and organizational records.We practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia’s highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear specifically:A drive to constantly improve through experimentation reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way we’re energized by the possibility of invention innovation and iterationBeing present in and grateful for the journey — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)Asking why then why again — because accepting “this is just the way it is” is not good enoughGrit & perseverance — a maker mentality that involves “rolling up your sleeves” but also deep care for oneself and for othersA commitment to uncovering talents to unlock “rock star” potential across every individualFurthermore excellence reflects the “bigness” and the “boldness” of Tia’s mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health as defined by herself.Said another way Tia’s mission is NOT to make healthcare incrementally better for women. Instead we’ve intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women’s healthcare that’s truly excellent. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a “one and done.” We have not and will not “get it right” with the first swing. Rather this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully “achieve.” By design we will never be “done” with this work but instead we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.

The world today is filled with static monolithic infrastructure. Factories power plants buildings etc. operate the same theyve operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades. Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically: We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. We focus on industrial applications which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning. We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do and we do it for them. Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMinds AlphaGo to reducing the energy required to cool Googles Data Centers by 40% we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

But it doesnât end there â we also provide automated fulfilment and warehousing services to go with it so they can store all their swag with us and ship it anywhere in the world as and when they need without lifting a finger.

Senior Software Engineer,https://remoteOK.com/remote-jobs/remote-senior-software-engineer-loancrate-350758,What is LoanCrate?We started LoanCrate to make home-buying simpler and less expensive for lenders and borrowers (us!). Today mortgage lenders are stuck running their companies on software products built 20 years ago. These products are slow and unstable and end up costing lenders millions of dollars in other otherwise preventable mistakes every year. LoanCrate solves those problems and more helping lenders improve the home-buying experience for people all over the country.Since starting in January 2021 our remote team has raised $9m grown to 15 people and launched our first product. And since adopting LoanCrate in June 21 our customers have used LoanCrate to power &gt;$50 billion in new home loans. As a company were on track to be cash-flow positive in 2023.Our team is a group of people excited to tackle the complexity of the home-lending industry. We care about collaboration very open communication covering the good &amp; the bad so that we learn from our decisions quickly and ultimately having fun while were building. Youll fit in well if you like diving deep quickly!The opportunityOur dreams are big and we have much to build! Were looking for senior software engineers to help lead our team in powering the future of home buying in the US (which could entail managing a majority of US home loans every year â financial assets worth trillions of dollars).We are excited to offer competitive salary and equity for this role.What to expectAs an engineer at LoanCrate youll continue our team tradition by shipping code to production on your first day! Following that within your first month youll dive into your first mission-critical project such as...ð Architecting building and launching v2 of our no-code platform that our customers use to digitize their ops workflows and save millions of dollars per year.ð¤ Integrating with 3rd-party providers of lending services APIs to generate documents/disclosures produce automated underwriting results or prevent fraud.ð Architecting building and launching the next generation of our job processing infrastructure on AWS to make LoanCrates back end more observable and reliable.Tech stackNearly all of our code is written in TypeScript. We use React on the frontend Node/Express on the backend (running inside Docker) GraphQL/Apollo on both sides and Postgres as our database. We use AWS (ECS RDS ElastiCache SNS and more) and manage all of our infrastructure with Terraform.We believe that high engineering velocity drives high product velocity (and in turn our success as a company ð). Keeping this in mind weve invested heavily in creating a great developer experience that enables engineers to ship fast. Some highlights of our stack:âï¸ End-to-End Type Safety - We generate TypeScript types from our Postgres and GraphQL schemas so that when we change our database schema we see type errors in any incompatible frontend React components.ð Full-Stack Code Sharing - Our build tooling supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client server and other packages in our mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.ð Reproducible Infrastructure - Weâve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any infrastructure changes using infrastructure thats identical to production.ð§ª First Class Testing Utilities - We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and feed automated end-to-end integration and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.Preferred skills and background(Its okay not to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!)ð A constant and keen eye for security risks â we store and display some of peoples most sensitive personal data and need to keep it safe!ð¨ A desire to be product-oriented from thinking through the product implications of what youre building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.ðï¸ Ability to develop readable maintainable and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for running their companies).ð©âð«ð¨âð« Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft skills.ð SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure thats reliable observable and requires minimal toil to maintain.ð©ï¸ Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud. Bonus points if youre experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or CloudFormation!ð§ Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.ð¢ï¸ Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas as well as figuring out performant ways to store retrieve and update such data.

Senior Independent UX/UI Designer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/design/senior-independent-ux-ui-designer-986276,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.  How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-08-16,Worldwide,2023-08-16 17:30:41.999295

Senior Independent Software Developer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-independent-software-developer-814298,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.      How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-08-16,Worldwide,2023-08-16 17:30:41.999316
