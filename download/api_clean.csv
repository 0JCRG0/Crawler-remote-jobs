You open the alert and all of the relevant facts are laid out for you. You know the whos the whats and the wheres of what happened and it’s all right there in the alert. You notice the attacker IP immediately you wonder “Where is that IP located?”. Wonder no more because the IP has already been fully enriched with all publicly available information! This looks bad just as you’re about to shift to the EDR console to see what kind of damage was done you notice further down that’s already been provided for you. You have full context of everything that happened before during and after this event and it’s confirming your suspicions. You raise the alarm and notify the customer that you’re digging into a potential security incident and it only took 20 seconds to make that decision. Now imagine the person that created that alert. This person understands security operations and has a keen understanding of what information is needed to make an informed decision about a potential attack. This person knows the sort of enrichment needed to provide the right context about the facts of the alert. This person has studied the metrics from previous investigations and knows where analysts get tripped up or slowed down on decisions during the moments that matter. Once identified they work tirelessly to streamline that and make sure the decisions can be made quickly. This person also enjoys working together on a team to prioritize the problems that matter and work toward a solution. This person also has a high degree of empathy and understands the demands of working in a SOC environment. They understand that scaling operations doesn’t always mean scaling with more people the real strength comes when you can arm analysts with the tools they need to become super heroes.

Staff Engineer,https://echojobs.io/job/phaidra-staff-engineer-wessj,Description About Phaidra Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation. The world today is filled with static monolithic infrastructure. Factories power plants buildings etc. operate the same theyve operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades. Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time.

Senior iOS Engineer,https://echojobs.io/job/tia-senior-ios-engineer-6bzsw,Description About us:Founded in 2017 by Carolyn Witte and Felicity Yost Tia is the modern medical home for women. We are trailblazing a new paradigm for women’s healthcare that treats women as whole people vs. parts or life stages. Blending in-person and virtual care services Tia’s “Whole Woman Whole Life” care model fuses gynecology primary care mental health and evidence-based wellness services to treat women comprehensively. By making women’s health higher quality and lower cost Tia makes women healthier providers happier and the business of care delivery stronger — setting a new standard of care for women everywhere.Tia has raised more than $132 Million in venture capital funding to date including a $100 Million Series B investment one of the largest early-stage rounds ever for a healthcare company focused on women. Since launching in 2017 Tia has grown to serve thousands of women aged 18-80 with blended in-person and virtual care in New York City Los Angeles Phoenix and San Francisco. In 2023 Tia announced its most recent joint venture partner Cedars-Sinai. Tia and Cedars-Sinai plan to serve more than 100 000 women in the Los Angeles region and aim to expand access to comprehensive women’s health care in a market with primary care/GYN provider shortages.Tia is building a culture of excellence — in people process and product. This is our northstar value.What is excellence exactly?Excellence about constantly elevating yourself it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities and identifying your top potential through constant learning experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead in our terms excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We’re looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records and organizational records.We practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia’s highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear specifically:A drive to constantly improve through experimentation reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way we’re energized by the possibility of invention innovation and iterationBeing present in and grateful for the journey — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)Asking why then why again — because accepting “this is just the way it is” is not good enoughGrit & perseverance — a maker mentality that involves “rolling up your sleeves” but also deep care for oneself and for othersA commitment to uncovering talents to unlock “rock star” potential across every individualFurthermore excellence reflects the “bigness” and the “boldness” of Tia’s mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health as defined by herself.Said another way Tia’s mission is NOT to make healthcare incrementally better for women. Instead we’ve intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women’s healthcare that’s truly excellent. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a “one and done.” We have not and will not “get it right” with the first swing. Rather this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully “achieve.” By design we will never be “done” with this work but instead we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.

We use React on the frontend Node/Express on the backend (running inside Docker) GraphQL/Apollo on both sides and Postgres as our database. We use AWS (ECS RDS ElastiCache SNS and more) and manage all of our infrastructure with Terraform.We believe that high engineering velocity drives high product velocity (and in turn our success as a company ð). Keeping this in mind weve invested heavily in creating a great developer experience that enables engineers to ship fast. Some highlights of our stack:âï¸ End-to-End Type Safety - We generate TypeScript types from our Postgres and GraphQL schemas so that when we change our database schema we see type errors in any incompatible frontend React components.ð Full-Stack Code Sharing - Our build tooling supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client server and other packages in our mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.ð Reproducible Infrastructure - Weâve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any infrastructure changes using infrastructure thats identical to production.ð§ª First Class Testing Utilities - We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and feed automated end-to-end integration and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.Preferred skills and background(Its okay not to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!)ð A constant and keen eye for security risks â we store and display some of peoples most sensitive personal data and need to keep it safe!ð¨ A desire to be product-oriented from thinking through the product implications of what youre building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.ðï¸ Ability to develop readable maintainable and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for running their companies).ð©âð«ð¨âð« Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft skills.ð SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure thats reliable observable and requires minimal toil to maintain.ð©ï¸ Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud. Bonus points if youre experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or CloudFormation!ð§ Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.ð¢ï¸ Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas as well as figuring out performant ways to store retrieve and update such data. Home loans have thousands of data fields ð.Please mention the word **ENDORSE** and tag RMjgwNjoyZjA6NzQyMDpmY2UzOjNkMWE6ZTJkOjk2NDM6YmUxMg== when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMjgwNjoyZjA6NzQyMDpmY2UzOjNkMWE6ZTJkOjk2NDM6YmUxMg==).

Senior Independent UX/UI Designer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/design/senior-independent-ux-ui-designer-986276,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.  How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-08-22,Worldwide,2023-08-22 22:01:50.403390

Senior Independent Software Developer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-independent-software-developer-814298,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.      How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-08-22,Worldwide,2023-08-22 22:01:50.403456
