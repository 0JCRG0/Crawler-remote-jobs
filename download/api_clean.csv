Senior Independent UX/UI Designer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/design/senior-independent-ux-ui-designer-986276,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.  How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-06-26,Worldwide,2023-06-26 11:40:28.619226

Senior Independent Software Developer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-independent-software-developer-814298,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.      How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-06-26,Worldwide,2023-06-26 11:40:28.619320
