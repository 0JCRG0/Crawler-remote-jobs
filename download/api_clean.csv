Senior Frontend Engineer,https://4dayweek.io/remote-job/senior-frontend-engineer-2-electric-sql,#### Senior Frontend Engineer (Typescript) ###### €80 000 - €100 000 \| 0.1 - 0.2% \| Remote occasional on-site in Europe We’re looking for an experienced front-end developer to join our core team to help develop the ElectricSQL local-first software platform. Your focus will be to develop our client-side components starting with our Typescript client. This is the primary developer touchpoint of the ElectricSQL system and includes APIs for authentication database driver integration component framework integrations and systems for reactivity and dynamic partial replication. Take a look at the code at electric-sql/electric/tree/maiclients/typescript(https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/maiclients/typescript) and watch this talk(http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sn_Ig5n2Oc0) to see where things are going. The work isn’t about building an application. It’s about crafting an open-source platform for other software developers to use that systemically solves the state transfer problem for local-first application development. Obviously you have extremely strong front-end development skills. Ideally you’ve worked as a tech lead and system architect. Naturally you’ve worked with a range of different reactive component frameworks. You’re experienced with a range of data modelling and state management techniques including relational data modelling and offline-first architectures. It would be great if you’ve worked with ORMs and query builders complex types and ideal if you’ve developed and maintained open source libraries. We have native framework integrations and we’re extracting our core client-side replication component to Rust for cross-environment portability and compilation to WASM. So any experience with Rust WASM mobile app development Swift Kotlin Dart Flutter React Native Expo would all also be very helpful and relevant. You must be able to demonstrate experience in a range of different professional settings and the ability to thrive in an early stage startup environment. (You don’t have to have worked at a startup but we need a clear indication that you’re going to thrive at this one). Finally it’s important that you’re genuinely motivated by the opportunity to invest your time and energy into building an open source platform that helps replace today’s siloed exploitative cloud-first systems with local-first software. Not only for the UX cost and reliability benefits but also for the ethical aspects of user ownership and privacy by design.,2023-06-14,,2023-06-14 14:24:03.620237
Local-first Software Developer (Elixir/Typescript),https://4dayweek.io/remote-job/local-first-software-developer-2-electric-sql,#### Local-first Software Developer (Elixir/Typescript) ###### €35 000 - €50 000 \| 0.025% \| Remote occasional on-site in Europe We’re looking for a junior to mid-level developer to join our core team to help develop ElectricSQL’s local-first software platform integrations and example applications. You’ll be working full-stack to build reactive realtime offline capable applications with the ElectricSQL system. You’ll contribute generally to developing the core ElectricSQL platform. And you’ll develop framework integrations such as reactive hooks for different front-end frameworks and DSLs for different back-end migration systems. You need to be a natural developer with great coding and communication skills. That needs to be backed up by at least 2 years’ professional software development experience. You must be proficient with Typescript the unix command line front-end build systems and at least one server-side language (that isn’t Javascript). It would be great if you’ve worked with relational database modelling. Ideally you’ve designed built and operated full stack systems yourself. Really you should have evidence of previous projects and open source contributions. It’s a generalist role. You’ll need to think about product developer engagement onboarding and usability as well as coding. It would be great if you also enjoy writing and advocacy. It’s also important to understand the environment you’ll be joining. We are a small distributed team of experienced technologists many of whom are world experts in their domain building an open source devtools startup. There’s lots of technical guidance and mentoring available. With people like the inventors of CRDTs and the creator of the Elixir programming language on team to work with and learn from. However we do not have many of the structured processes support and management mechanisms that you’ll find in a larger company. You have to be able to thrive on your own initiative communicate effectively ask the right questions provide clarity as much as you demand it and get stuff done in the presence of uncertainty. So one of the key things we’re looking for (and will select for) is the ability to be pro-active and self-managing. We’re an open source project so here’s a clue: applying for the job with a well written personalised email is not the only opportunity you have to impress us right now.,2023-06-14,,2023-06-14 14:24:03.620244

Mastermind Community Director,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/customer-support/mastermind-community-director-1708320,We are looking for a Mastermind Director who would love the chance to create from scratch the best online and in-person mastermind group of digital entrepreneurs that exists online. We are a coaching company and do a really good job at that. However only having a 1:1 coach isn’t enough. It’s like being single parented and having no friends. It’s both a TON of work for the parent and limiting for our clients. That’s why we need you. Our clients need legitimate support from their peers (Hello Mastermind!) just as much as they need an amazing coach to be in their corner. We believe that humans are underrated that we are created in the image of God. And when we turn our ideas into legit products that help people the world is a better place and the kingdom expands. That’s why our mission is making it nearly impossible to fail for our clients to get customers.This allows our clients to have more impact make really cool stuff and not have to spend every waking hour worrying about revenue. We need you. Yesterday.This role is a top priority in the company. Why?Because we have over 100 clients eagerly anticipating the launch of our peer-led mastermind groups but we have no one on our team to recruit the leaders train them and roll it out. And without growing and thriving peer groups our clients arent reaching their potential. We need to add a legit Mastermind Director to our team to help us do this. We’ve been coaching companies and solopreneurs in marketing for 10 years. Along the way we’ve discovered several new innovative and extremely effective methodologies.So if the idea of creating a thriving peer support group for CMOs founders and aspiring entrepreneurs of some of the most impactful innovative and fun companies in the world sounds exciting—keep reading. :)This role is important because without you we will not have the capacity to expand our coaching program and reach more clients. We need you to help us change the world one client at a time.What will you learn in this role?If you come from a ministry background perhaps as a small group pastor but have disliked the toxic culture low pay or lack of open-mindedness and innovation you’ll love this role.If you have been running your own business but are tired of doing everything yourself and working alone and you crave a healthy team on an exciting mission youll love this role.However if you prefer highly defined day-to-day duties dont really enjoy figuring things out and trying new processes seems intimidating you wont do well in this role.There is 0 red tape at Growth Tools. We don’t care about how other people have always done things how you have always done things or what anyones SOP is. What we care about is: 1) you love what you do every day and wake up excited to do it; and 2) our clients success.We ruthlessly measure both on a daily basis.In this role you will learn:1. How to recruit and train small group peer leaders2. How to create small peer-led mastermind groups that thrive with genuine relationship and connection3. How to host live hot seats and work-a-long sessions for clients4. How to get highly influential business leaders and influencers to do Q&amp;As with our clients In your role as Mastermind Director you will own 2 numbers: 1. % of clients engaged each week 2. NPS score of the mastermindYou’ll walk away from your time at Growth Tools having been an influential voice in creating and scaling one of the most innovative online education and coaching products that exists.This role will have been a success if you say: “That was the best team I’ve ever been a part of and the product we created is a high watermark of my career!”Who will you work with?You will report directly to Bryan Harris our founder and Chief Product Officer.The product team is a small team of 10 employees and the fastest growing division in the company. It is made up of both the coaching team and the software engineering team.We are a different kind of company.

We all work remotely and are scattered around North America from Vancouver to Cleveland and Nashville to Birmingham. That means you have the flexibility to work from home or a coworking location.What does Growth Tools do and why?Growth Tools provides the tools and training to help online businesses once and for all solve the problem of getting more clients. We work primarily with teaching based businesses (course creators influencers coaches etc.) to help them significantly grow their revenue and impact—including getting them on the INC. 5000 list. Our tools consist of 10 SaaS products that we give away for free. Our training consists of a 1:1 coaching business Growth University.We believe that humans are underrated and that we drastically underestimate what we’re capable of. While much of the news and social media is focused on the negative we have seen firsthand what a hope-filled entrepreneur is capable of and how much good they can do! At Growth Tools our job is to help every client grow their business so more people can be helped and more good is done.Example:One of our clients Chaitra Rahhakrishna runs a small design studio. She works with e-commerce companies and helps them create beautiful websites that showcase and sell their products.When we first started working with her she had $0 revenue and had just given birth to her first child. 12 months later while being an awesome mom she also grew her studio to $100 000.

Senior Independent UX/UI Designer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/design/senior-independent-ux-ui-designer-986276,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers &amp; product managers) to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.  How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-06-14,Worldwide,2023-06-14 14:24:05.321725

Senior Independent Software Developer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-independent-software-developer-814298,A·Team is a VC-backed stealth application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked high-growth companies on their next big thing.  After talking with hundreds of independent engineers designers and product folks we heard over and over that finding vetted high-quality consistent clients is hard and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z YC Softbank General Catalyst etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020 and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since. As part of A·Team you can expect:  High-paying meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr with vetted fascinating clients doing work that matters. Were picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. Weve worked with Lyft McGraw Hill ClearCo irl.com the former CEO of Waze the leading vaccine production software several new unicorns we cant say here and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc. Work alongside friends old &amp; new: our niche is small/diverse product teams since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams not individuals. Of course we keep friends together whenever we can. Full autonomy: say no to things that dont excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once so theres never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you dont have the bandwidth. If were no longer a fit its easy to leave or pause too.  Small curated off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term were creating micro-communities for the worlds top builders to become friends around the things they care about. Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small flat transparent platform fee on top of your rate.      How to apply: Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were also much more interested in seeing what youve made and excited to chat more if there’s a fit. What you’ll do:   Once part of A.Team you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders to fast-growing super-funded companies to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would   Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.    You’ll be paid to scope it out give the client options guide strategy and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.    Who A·Team is for:   Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.   Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.   The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) bootstrapping a side project or looking for their next big thing   Who A·Team is not for:   People looking for small gigs   Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites   Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)   Our long-term vision: A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small autonomous distributed expert teams.  To help us secure amazing missions we raised $5 million+ (not public yet) from NFX Village Global and Box Group along with the former CEO of Upwork the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade Apples Global Head of Recruiting YC Partner Aaron Harris Whartons Adam Grant and Dukes Dan Ariely. ,2023-06-14,Worldwide,2023-06-14 14:24:05.321849
