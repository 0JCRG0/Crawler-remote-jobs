We strive to make competitive offers allowing employees room for future growth.

We have built a cutting edge workforce engagement suite which leverages AI and machine learning to deliver labor efficiency for employers and great experiences for employees across the Retail, Hospitality, and Fitness industries. Legion is backed by preeminent venture firms such as Norwest Venture Partners, First Round Capital, and XYZ Ventures and is based in Redwood City, California. The hourly workforce currently constitutes almost 60% of the overall labor market in the United States and these nearly 80 million hourly workers are the driving force behind many of our largest domestic industries like food/beverage, retail and hospitality. Management of this workforce has historically been difficult due to high churn (average of 60%), high cost of replacement (average of $3,200 per employee in retail) and now new challenges are developing as millennials enter this market. The retail vertical alone spends $62 billion dollars a year on replacing workers and over 50% of hourly workers leave their jobs because of flexibility reasons. In our modern, Uber-ized times, younger folks seek gig-like flexibility, modern mobile first technology and compelling work options. They want to use an app on their phone to schedule work, not haggle with the manager over their schedule on a week to week basis. Likewise, employers are increasingly in need of a flexible and efficient labor model that supports the innovations (think pop up stores, home delivery, mobile ordering, service options etc) needed, and frankly demanded, by today’s modern customers. Mid market organizations have never had a technology platform to manage their hourly workers and the enterprise is mired in decades old technology (think Kronos, Infor) that’s both user unfriendly and wildly ineffective for managing today’s modern hourly workforce. There is a huge opportunity to modernize and upgrade how hourly workers interact with their employers and while enabling employers to be elastic, efficient and innovative...but no one has cracked the code until now. ENTER LEGION Legion’s mission is to build the platform that enables this transition. We have built a workforce engagement solution that applies AI and machine learning to accurately forecast demand and automatically match employees to work. The simple notion of matching work that needs to be done to the best suited employee who wants it and doing so in a fair, compliant and efficient manner is fundamental to today’s new job economy. The Legion platform provides flexible, efficient ways for employers and employees to engage with each other and enable the future of work. At its core, this is a supply versus demand issue. Legion is able to use advanced machine learning to accurately predict how much work needs to be done and by what roles and skills. These forecasts are fully automated and tailored to the unique attributes of every location and take into account factors that impact customer traffic. For instance, rain could decrease customer traffic at an outdoor cafe but would likely increase the volume of delivery orders. Legion now helps you predictably staff for these events, and it gets more and more accurate as it ingests more data. Legion then uses AI to automatically match these forecasts to the best employees based on a wide variety of factors such as employee preference, skill, productivity and labor compliance policies. Likewise all of these rules are easily customizable to a unique business, policies and best practices of every customer. Legion is able to make informed and practical autonomous business decisions for every customer with the simple push of a button. Legion is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, national origin, veteran, disability status, or any other basis covered by appropriate law. How We Determine What We Pay As a fully remote employer, Legion determines pay for positions using local, national, and industry-specific survey data. We evaluate external equity and the cost of labor/prevailing wage index in the relative marketplace for jobs directly comparable to jobs within our company. Our posted salary range is based on national data and may be refined for a candidates regiotowcost of living. For new hires, we strive to make competitive offers allowing the new employee room for future growth. Salaries will be based on the applicant’s location, level of experience, education, and specialized knowledge and skills. Additionally, we consider the external market rate, the amount we have budgeted internally, and internal equity within the company for the same position.

Our vision is that any patient, no matter where they are located, should be able to participate in clinical trials at home and with their own doctors. This is made possible through a unique suite of tools Curebase’s has designed to engage patients in clinical trials across all settings, be it at home, at their local clinic, or other places in their community. This starts with Curebase’s leading decentralized clinical trial software platform that is an all-in-one, purpose built eClinical software system, with every tool needed to manage and collect data for decentralized clinical trials. This includes ePRO, eCOA, eConsent, Telemedicine, and much more. Curebase also offers a virtual research site, complete with virtual investigators, research coordinators, mobile nursing, and other healthcare staff that administer care to patients where convenient for them, just like any other research site, but with the ability to stand up anywhere and with greater patient convenience and reach. Notably, Curebase is the pioneer of the “BYOP” or Bring Your Own Physician model, allowing patients to use their own doctors to participate in clinical trials. We are reinventing a $45B market, enabling drug and device companies to increase the volume, quality, and speed of data collection regardless of patients’ physical location. COVID-19 tailwinds have created massive demand for telemedicine and home-based trials, with two new FDA guidance letters and industry-wide adoption of remote remote research that will only accelerate in the years to come.

Elasticsearch consultant,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11264/elasticsearch-consultant-at-the-organized-crime-and-corruption-reporting-project-occrp/,"Application deadline: 30/06/2023About OCCRPThe Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a growing, global nonprofit media organization that is reinventing investigative journalism for the public good. By developing and equipping a global network of investigative journalists and publishing their stories, we expose crime and corruption so the public can hold power to account. We see a future where organized crime and corruption are drastically reduced and democracy is strengthened. Our global team includes editors, researchers, data engineers, security specialists, administrators, technologists, and strategists, each with areas of in-depth expertise.AlephTo support investigative journalists and member centers in their work to uncover corruption and hold power to account, OCCRP developed an investigative data platform called OCCRP Aleph. The platform serves as a central repository for exploring leaks, datasets and and data-dumps that are critical to effective investigative journalism. This platform now contains over 3 billion records and has served as a cornerstone in many global groundbreaking investigations. The platform allows journalists to ingest documents and both structured and unstructured data, and maps that data to an ontology that we developed called Follow the Money. Users can then search across all Aleph datasets to find connections, entities and cross-reference entities between datasets to uncover wrongdoing and patterns. This is largely possible through our use of Elasticsearch (ES), which is a central part of the application enabling rapid search through records. The platform that we’ve developed runs in a kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP. Our ES cluster comprises 21 Nodes including 3 master nodes. Each node uses a 2Tb SSD with 26Gb RAM and 4 vCPUs.The user-facing side of Aleph is written in Python and React with a Postgres database and an accompanying suite of CLI tools.The ProjectThe ChallengeAleph has now been in use for over seven years and in that time our ES index has grown significantly. The ES index is currently 30Tb and is increasing in size all the time. Although this growth is a testament to the success of the platform and the popularity of it with our users, it has brought with it very significant running costs.As such, the primary goal of this project is to investigate and optimize our current ES setup, in the hope of making it more space-efficient and cost effective and without impacting performance or usefulness of the platform for our users. Where you can helpAs an ElasticSearch expert, you will work closely with the Aleph development team to: ● Audit the current ElasticSearch implementation and propose possible tweaks and other ‘low-hanging-fruit’ changes we could make to improve cost efficiency. ● Understand the current ES setup and implementation and how it is tied into Aleph’s core functionality.● Investigate avenues for potential improvement of cost efficiency.● Propose architectural changes (small or large) to our ES implementation or Aleph as a whole that could significantly improve cost effectiveness without compromising performance.● Help us implement these changes (development, planning, architecture) when we know what they are.As the expert we’d expect you to make recommendations but there are several avenues that we’ve considered:● Optimizing our existing configuration to try and reduce the size of our index.● Setting up hot/cold nodes within the index for less frequently accessed data where longer retrieval time is more acceptable.● Refactoring the way in which data is split across indexes to allow better more efficient searches.● Setting up an archive process for taking data offline (and reducing the size of our index).What you bring to the table● Significant experience working with elasticsearch and ideally with performance and cost optimization.● Ideally experience working with an NGO● Solutions-oriented outlook and collaborative mindset to bring creative solutions to the tableHow to applyIf you’re interested in helping us with the project, either as an individual or as an organization we’d love to hear from you.For IndividualsIf you’re an individual interested in getting involved, please email us a copy of your CV along with a cover letter detailing your interest and daily rates to jobs(at)occrp.org Once we’re received this we’ll evaluate and reach out.For OrganizationsIf you’re an organization looking to provide us with professional services then please email us at jobs(at)occrp.org including information on your organization, your rates, availability, and why you believe that you are best placed to help us, and we’ll arrange a time to talk.All applications must be submitted in English.

Managing Director,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11227/managing-director-at-matrixorg-foundation/,"The Matrix.org Foundation is a non-profit UK Community Interest Company that serves as both a guardian and champion of Matrix, an open standard and protocol for real-time communication that is used by an ever-growing global community. Matrix is to communicating in the 21st century what e-mail was to sending messages in the 20th – an interoperable and federated protocol that makes it possible for anyone, anywhere in the world, to connect to users anywhere on the global network in a safe, reliable manner. While work on Matrix began in 2014, today ongoing development of the specification is entrusted to the Foundation, currently led by a group of five Guardians who keep a watchful eye on the Matrix Spec Core Team and its work, making sure the community stays true to its overall philosophy. To date, most of the work of the Foundation has been provided through in-kind efforts of ecosystem leaders, such as Element. These contributions have included general outreach and advocacy for Matrix, operation of the massively popular Matrix.org homeserver, and funding software development for projects including end-to-end encryption, client SDKs and Synapse, the Matrix reference homeserver implementation. While these external contributions have been and remain critical, the Foundation takes seriously its responsibility to the long-term success of Matrix, and so recently began to transition into a more direct and hands-on role in key areas. The Role As we begin to prepare for the 2nd decade of Matrix and respond to the community’s rapid growth, the Foundation is seeking its first Managing Director to: (a) build support for the evolution of the ecosystem of service providers and software developers building technology and services on the Matrix protocol, (b) to oversee development and operations of key technology infrastructure and community resources, and © to help ensure the Foundation’s fiscal sustainability for the long term in order to provide stability and assurance to users and contributors. This role is responsible for strategy, operations, and fundraising for the Foundation in service to the larger Matrix community. The role reports to the newly-forming Matrix Governing Board via the long-established committee of Guardians who have deep ongoing experience with the ecosystem’s history, successes, and challenges. The person in this role will also initially be responsible for taking over certain tasks from predecessor volunteers and outsourced providers, including such tasks as annual tax & reporting filings, maintenance of the Foundation’s online presence, and overseeing key community events/programs/activities (conferences, participation in standards groups, Google Summer of Code, etc.). Requirements The Foundation’s inaugural Managing Director will have an especially critical responsibility to design strategic plans, operational approaches, and help to build a culture that is aligned with the long-term goals of the Matrix community and to the extent possible supports its work in all its forms. You will not only need to build the plans for the future of the Foundation, you will also be responsible to raise funds to execute those plans, and then transform those plans into reality through building internal teams and ecosystem partnerships. Specifically, we are looking for someone who is: * Intellectually and emotionally smart, naturally curious, and deeply enthusiastic about our mission. * A compelling and articulate communicator (both in written form and through public speaking) who takes great pleasure in helping others be successful. * Empathetic, with not only Matrix ecosystem members, but also users and potential supporters. * Comfortable with the pace, trade offs, and ambiguity of an early stage non-profit organization, and who remembers how to balance their own self-care alongside caring for and supporting others in our community. * Comfortable “wearing many hats” and taking on a variety of roles temporarily as the organization builds its team. * Not afraid to explain to people that changing the world takes both resources and money, and to enthusiastically solicit financial support for the Foundation in doing so. Your experience First and foremost, we are looking for someone who is deeply passionate about the Matrix mission for democratising communication, and who will be an outspoken advocate for our work. We also need someone with not only deep experience in building organizations and communities, but also in organizational development work such as fundraising and partnership building. We expect the successful candidate to have the following experience: * Past experience building a fundraising pipeline to support annual operating budgets. Based on the desired activities of the Foundation, our target annual budgets will be in the $4-5M range. * Existing access to a wide network of funding organizations and comfort making contact with new organizations to build relationships and solicit support. * Experience leading free and open source software projects. * Experience with implementing and supporting back-office technology such as project management tools, CRM (for members management) and fundraising campaign software. The following attributes will make your application stand out even more: Experience with software development practices (e.g. coding, QA, design, management) will help to understand the needs and challenges of Matrix contributors. Hands-on experience with the Matrix project, such as software development or running your own homeserver, would help you to better understand some of the practical issues and roadmap for Matrix. Technical experience with other real-time messaging platforms would be helpful for the same reasons. * We are a global project and expect to work with community members, partners, and donors in multiple countries. So past experience working with colleagues across multiple countries, as is fluency in multiple written and spoken languages. Benefits This position is designed to be remote. Most of your colleagues will be located in Europe, so you should be willing and able to readily communicate in those time zones. As the first official role directly serving the Foundation, we are opening this role as an independent contractor/consultant relationship in order to provide maximum flexibility in the early phase of the newly-energized organization. As is the case with most new organizations yet to name a leader, funding is currently limited but we will work to both provide flexibility to the right person, and to provide fair compensation that is competitive with other similar opportunities qualified candidates may have. Depending on a candidate’s needs and situation, we may also be able to offer a direct hire relationship if needed. Because this role will be the first paid role in the organization, employee benefits are not yet established. However, once recurring funding is secured the Foundation’s current leadership is committed to a budget and building revenue sources that will accommodate a competitive benefits package for all employees, including retirement savings, allowances for workspace costs, paid leave, and healthcare benefits as necessary. The Matrix.org Foundation does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, colour, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits. How To Apply If you are interested in this role and think you might be qualified, we encourage you to get in touch with us. We especially encourage people subject to systematic bias or impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry to apply.

We will contact those candidates who are short-listed on a rolling basis as we receive application materials, so please don’t delay in applying. We may request examples of your past relevant work in order to better understand how your experience would work in our organization.

Workforces are now distributed and no longer office-based every day, meaning that yesterdays commuter has become tomorrows business traveler. Having up-to-date data to decide whether to meet in person, virtually or in a hybrid format is a must-have for companies of any size; however, this has been available to access dynamically from a single source just now, the TROOP.As companies focus on their environmental commitments, they are turning to TROOP to help guide their teams as they aim to keep to carbon targets.The purpose of a meeting is more important than ever to understand, and when approving a meeting, the costs and time spent traveling are key data to inform this investment decision.Staff wellness is vital to optimizing performance in todays workforce. Understanding the impact on staff when planning a meeting by understanding the range of time zones people are attending and the time spent traveling to participate in the meeting allows for more thoughtful scheduling and choice of location.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale. Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

Senior Accountant,https://remote.co/job/senior-accountant-27-4/,"Senior Accountant REMOTE FINANCE FULL-TIME We’re building something. We aren’t shy about our ambitions. Everyone at RenoFi is committed to making renovations possible for every homeowner in America. We’re growing fast and we’re looking for an entrepreneurial and detail-oriented accounting pro who has the skills and horsepower to scale with us.

You’re energized by solving puzzles and can’t walk away from one until you’ve solved it. You’re a numbers guru at heart, but your superpower is communication.

We are committed to hiring and cultivating a diverse team. If you are uncertain about whether you meet our requirements, please apply anyway! ABOUT US: The demand for home renovations has never been stronger, yet, it’s surprisingly difficult for a new homeowner to renovate. It can take a decade to build up enough home equity and savings to pay for a major renovation. As a result, recent homeowners do a lot of financially-suboptimal things to compensate like borrow from their 401k, rack up credit card debt, and use high-interest personal loans. Or they just live unhappily for years in a home that doesn’t meet their family’s needs. But by completing a major renovation, homeowners are increasing the value of their home. Professional real estate investors leverage this After Renovation Value (ARV) to roll the increase in value into new properties all the time. But there hasn’t been a great way for homeowners to take advantage of this. If homeowners had an ability to borrow against the ARV, they could increase their borrowing power up to 10x. To meet this need, RenoFi created a platform that enables homeowners to borrow funds from RenoFi approved lenders in the form of the first home equity loan purpose-built for renovations! Unlike standard home equity loans, RenoFi Loans use the value of your home post-renovation which lets you borrow the most money at the best possible terms. RenoFi is creating a full suite of renovation loan products to better suit the needs of today’s homeowners! For homeowners, RenoFi makes it possible to renovate years earlier than might be otherwise feasible. For contractors, we empower the financing of renovations at the point of sale, reducing instances of scope reduction, and ensuring prompt payment. Our lender partners, most often credit unions, rely on RenoFi’s platform to generate loans, create efficiencies, and grow membership. The lenders pay RenoFi for the new loans, which allows us to offer our services to homeowners for free. RenoFi is truly a win-win-win for everyone involved. RenoFi is backed by some of the best startup investors in the world, including First Round Capital, Comcast Ventures, and Canaan Partners. WE ARE A GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED TEAM RenoFi has been built from the start as a fully distributed team with an intentional focus on growing a strong team and culture that spans timezones and nationalities. Here’s one fun example! Please highlight any prior experience working remotely when applying. US or GMT-adjacent timezones will be prioritized. RenoFi offers competitive cash and equity compensation. Some benefit offerings will vary from country to country. In the United States, we offer competitive health and retirement plans. All staff across the globe enjoy a flexible vacation policy.",2023-07-04,International,2023-07-04 15:27:07.978470
