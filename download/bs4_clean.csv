Elasticsearch consultant,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11264/elasticsearch-consultant-at-the-organized-crime-and-corruption-reporting-project-occrp/,"Application deadline: 30/06/2023About OCCRPThe Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a growing, global nonprofit media organization that is reinventing investigative journalism for the public good. By developing and equipping a global network of investigative journalists and publishing their stories, we expose crime and corruption so the public can hold power to account. We see a future where organized crime and corruption are drastically reduced and democracy is strengthened. Our global team includes editors, researchers, data engineers, security specialists, administrators, technologists, and strategists, each with areas of in-depth expertise.AlephTo support investigative journalists and member centers in their work to uncover corruption and hold power to account, OCCRP developed an investigative data platform called OCCRP Aleph. The platform serves as a central repository for exploring leaks, datasets and and data-dumps that are critical to effective investigative journalism. This platform now contains over 3 billion records and has served as a cornerstone in many global groundbreaking investigations. The platform allows journalists to ingest documents and both structured and unstructured data, and maps that data to an ontology that we developed called Follow the Money. Users can then search across all Aleph datasets to find connections, entities and cross-reference entities between datasets to uncover wrongdoing and patterns. This is largely possible through our use of Elasticsearch (ES), which is a central part of the application enabling rapid search through records. The platform that we‚Äôve developed runs in a kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP. Our ES cluster comprises 21 Nodes including 3 master nodes. Each node uses a 2Tb SSD with 26Gb RAM and 4 vCPUs.The user-facing side of Aleph is written in Python and React with a Postgres database and an accompanying suite of CLI tools.The ProjectThe ChallengeAleph has now been in use for over seven years and in that time our ES index has grown significantly. The ES index is currently 30Tb and is increasing in size all the time. Although this growth is a testament to the success of the platform and the popularity of it with our users, it has brought with it very significant running costs.As such, the primary goal of this project is to investigate and optimize our current ES setup, in the hope of making it more space-efficient and cost effective and without impacting performance or usefulness of the platform for our users. Where you can helpAs an ElasticSearch expert, you will work closely with the Aleph development team to: ‚óè Audit the current ElasticSearch implementation and propose possible tweaks and other ‚Äòlow-hanging-fruit‚Äô changes we could make to improve cost efficiency. ‚óè Understand the current ES setup and implementation and how it is tied into Aleph‚Äôs core functionality.‚óè Investigate avenues for potential improvement of cost efficiency.‚óè Propose architectural changes (small or large) to our ES implementation or Aleph as a whole that could significantly improve cost effectiveness without compromising performance.‚óè Help us implement these changes (development, planning, architecture) when we know what they are.As the expert we‚Äôd expect you to make recommendations but there are several avenues that we‚Äôve considered:‚óè Optimizing our existing configuration to try and reduce the size of our index.‚óè Setting up hot/cold nodes within the index for less frequently accessed data where longer retrieval time is more acceptable.‚óè Refactoring the way in which data is split across indexes to allow better more efficient searches.‚óè Setting up an archive process for taking data offline (and reducing the size of our index).What you bring to the table‚óè Significant experience working with elasticsearch and ideally with performance and cost optimization.‚óè Ideally experience working with an NGO‚óè Solutions-oriented outlook and collaborative mindset to bring creative solutions to the tableHow to applyIf you‚Äôre interested in helping us with the project, either as an individual or as an organization we‚Äôd love to hear from you.For IndividualsIf you‚Äôre an individual interested in getting involved, please email us a copy of your CV along with a cover letter detailing your interest and daily rates to jobs(at)occrp.org Once we‚Äôre received this we‚Äôll evaluate and reach out.For OrganizationsIf you‚Äôre an organization looking to provide us with professional services then please email us at jobs(at)occrp.org including information on your organization, your rates, availability, and why you believe that you are best placed to help us, and we‚Äôll arrange a time to talk.All applications must be submitted in English.

Workforces are now distributed and no longer office-based every day, meaning that yesterdays commuter has become tomorrows business traveler. Having up-to-date data to decide whether to meet in person, virtually or in a hybrid format is a must-have for companies of any size; however, this has been available to access dynamically from a single source just now, the TROOP.As companies focus on their environmental commitments, they are turning to TROOP to help guide their teams as they aim to keep to carbon targets.The purpose of a meeting is more important than ever to understand, and when approving a meeting, the costs and time spent traveling are key data to inform this investment decision.Staff wellness is vital to optimizing performance in todays workforce. Understanding the impact on staff when planning a meeting by understanding the range of time zones people are attending and the time spent traveling to participate in the meeting allows for more thoughtful scheduling and choice of location. We have ambitious goals to be the leading solution in introducing an end-to-end experience, including booking, taking our data to where the conversation is being had, and much more.TROOPs CultureOur culture is built on an African philosophy called Ubuntu, which means I am because we are.

Evaluate the AI Our partner‚Äôs mission is to develop AI models that are safe, accurate, and beneficial to humanity. You will continuously evaluate the AI according to those criteria and our training methods. For example, you will be discerning the accuracy of the facts that the AI is outputting, but also the accuracy with which they interpret them. Test the AI How is testing different from evaluation? As the project grows over time, you‚Äôll spend time actively trying to break the AI by forcing mistakes and improving the way these AI models recover. This is absolutely critical to its safety, accuracy, and use. You‚Äôll document breaks and have the opportunity to recommend improvements to the training methods themselves to both our team and our client. The Person This is a technology job that accommodates humanities people and relies more fully on your competencies than your formal experience making it a rare opportunity that‚Äôs perfect for new grads, career transitioners, and those seeking an exciting encore career.
