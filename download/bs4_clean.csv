"Product Designer (Contract, $110-190/hr)",https://dribbble.com/jobs/99206-Product-Designer-Contract-110-190-hr?source=index,"A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only platform for senior product designers to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $7.3+ million since.As part of A·Team, you can expect: High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. A·Team is picky, and only works with companies referred to us by top funds or existing members and clients such as Lyft, McGraw Hill, the former-CEO of Waze, a few new unicorns, and dozens of venture-backed startups by a16z, YC, Softbank, GC, etc. Keep 100% of what you make: we exist to empower independent builders, which is why A.Team charges a percentage on top of your standard rate. Do more with a team you like: our focus is on small, diverse, cross-functional teams of insanely talented developers, PMs, designers, growth leads, etc. This is because clients with bigger budgets & more ambitious work need teams to solve problems, not individuals to do tasks. That said, we try to keep friends together, since clients love builders who have worked together before. Full autonomy: we only want you to join teams when the timings right. Often they start around 15-20hrs/week, and last at least 3-6 months (longer if its going great, or contract-to-hire if true love is found). Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations you wouldnt have elsewhere & connecting with other top-tier builders who you may like to collaborate with. How to apply:Go here: https://build.a.team/dribbble + mention Dribbble under how did you hear about A·Team? No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were super interested in seeing what youve made, so drop in a link to your Dribbble profile. Excited to chat more real soon if there’s a fit.What you’ll do: Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. Who A·Team is for: Senior product designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy. Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders. The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing Who A·Team is not for: People looking for small gigs Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet) Our long-term vision:A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apples Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Whartons Adam Grant, and Dukes Dan Ariely.",2023-08-22,Anywhere,2023-08-22 22:03:00.474768

Other apps can be effective, but often are not truly fun and are very difficult to use consistently. Hence users rely on forcing themselves to use them.In contrast, our app inspires excitement, acts as a platform for learners to make friends, is extremely fun, easy to use consistently and therefore makes one’s language learning journey so much better.

Senior Software Engineer (Fullstack),https://himalayas.app/companies/abridge/jobs/senior-software-engineer-fullstack-4652356898,"Health care is all about conversations, with over 2B spoken conversations each year between patients and their care teams in just the United States. However, people forget up to 80% of those conversations, leading to worse patient outcomes. And doctors are burning out writing notes in their EMRs instead of focusing on their patients. That’s where Abridge comes in — our audio-based standalone and integrated solutions record and summarize medical conversations, anywhere care happens.About the role:We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the team building our telehealth solution and other web+API components. You’ll play a key role in our technology decisions and implementation, and as part of our team you’ll see firsthand the impact that we’re making on healthcare.Your responsibilities: Help us scale up our business by designing, building, and supporting easy-to-use web applications and APIs Make and implement technology decisions that support business needs without compromising security, privacy, or quality Enhance existing systems with new functionality, increased performance, and improved stability Build deep user empathy and maintain a user-centric mindset Share your ideas, knowledge and experience during design discussions, code reviews, retrospectives, and other collaborative forums Communicate regularly and effectively with team members and other colleagues Ideally, you: Have several years’ experience building, shipping, and operating web applications and APIs at scale. You’ve seen what works, and probably a few things that didn’t work. Have been the lead engineer on a major component or subsystem of a software platform, or have been the lead for the platform itself Are excited about working in our tech stack, which is primarily NodeJS, Firebase, and React running on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Are independent and self-directed, and work well in a team Are willing to pitch in wherever needed - as a fast-moving startup we need to do good work, quickly We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you. Location: Pittsburgh or Boston strongly preferred. Post-pandemic, remote team members may be asked to travel for team events a few times each year.Life at AbridgeAt Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrators mandate.Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.Abridge is an equal opportunity employer.

Workforces are now distributed and no longer office-based every day, meaning that yesterdays commuter has become tomorrows business traveler.

Senior or Principal Product Designer,https://remote.co/job/senior-or-principal-product-designer-17/,"Senior or Principal Product Designer Location: K benhavn, Capital RegionDenmark, Denmark Who are we? We are on a mission to make video easy for anyone Synthesia is the world’s #1 AI video generation platform. Well, it’s actually a video production studio in a browser. As in, no cameras or film crews at all. You simply choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 120 languages, and your video is ready in minutes. In Synthesia, you can build personalised on-the-fly videos, give your chatbot a human face or run 24/7 weather channels in different languages, to name just a few of the possibilities. We believe the future of media is synthetic, and we are on a mission to turn cameras into code and make everyone a creator. Not sure what we’re talking about? Check out our brand video that explains what we’re doing at Synthesia in a way that even our grandparents *kind of * understand what this AI video stuff is all about. And yet we are just laying the groundwork for a whole new kind of media here. Imagine joining Uber, Airbnb or Stripe when these companies were just getting started. That’s how early we are but enough about us now. As a Product Designer at Synthesia, you’ll work across all areas of our product. About the role: As a Product Designer at Synthesia, you’ll work across all areas of our product. The work you do will be shaped by following product principles: Build for everyone. We aim to put new creative powers in the hands of all our users. We’re not building a specialist tool, but a generalist one that will sit next to word processors, presentation software, and spreadsheet applications as staple used by many. This means you’ll need to rethink existing UX paradigms to meet their needs. Approachable on the surface, powerful in depth. The longer a user spends in our product, the more they’ll discover. You’ll need to successfully balance the tension of ensuring users have the advanced capabilities they need while maintaining a straightforward & accessible UI. Aim for repeatable patterns. Repeatable patterns help our users form a consistent mental model in the face of new paradigms and reuse what they’ve learned. Patterns also yield principled and reusable code resulting in better partnership alongside your engineering peers. What you will be working on: There are many complex challenges for a Product Designer at Synthesia. We’re moving away from the prevailing UX paradigm that video creation is built around the timeline. As part of this, you may help invent new patterns that enable our users to base content production around their script. As we look to enable a richer content experience, you could enable our users to have greater control over the levels of emotion or angles we see in our AI avatars. In this role you will: Partner with our Head of Product, Product Managers, Engineers, and other Product Designers to imagine the future of synthetic media. Leverage feedback from our users to ensure our product continues to meet their needs Tackle complex and novel problems as we mature our nascent product. Play a key role in the early stages of product development as part of a team that aspires to create one of the best designed SaaS tools out there. Work with a team that ships fast and iterates quickly. Help shape how product, design, and engineering is done at a fast growing Series B. Solve our most important UX problems and shape the future of Synthesia – from the initial idea stage to the final execution. You should apply if you bring: 3+ years of experience in designing SaaS web apps or B2C products Strong product opinions and taste. We look for designers who will not shy away from proposing solutions based on your intuition and experience. Ability to think at a high level about product strategy and clearly articulate design decisions. Ability to take ownership of the design process and work as a self-directed member of the development team. Strong UX focus and understanding of human behaviour. Proven track record of creating beautiful, cohesive and meaningful design and UI, strong attention to details. Effective verbal and written communication skills. Designers who bring the following will stand out: Interactive prototyping skills Motion design experience Strong visual design skills (typography, illustrations, iconography and brand design) Frontend skills in HTML, CSS, JS and experience with Git. Significant experience working on tooling. At Synthesia we expect everyone to: Be an owner. Focus on outcomes over Inputs and Plans. Make the journey fun Default to simple. You can expect the following in return… A competitive salary + stock options in our fast growing Series B start-up. A remote-first environment. You’ll also have the options to work from one of our offices in London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam or Munich if you choose. We work to UK hours and start our day at 8am-10am GMT+1. 25 days of annual leave + public holidays in the country where you are based. Regular socials and company retreats. 4 weeks paid sabbatical after 4 years at the company + $10,000!! Paid parental leave. A generous referral scheme.
