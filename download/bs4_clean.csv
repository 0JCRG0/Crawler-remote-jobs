"Product Designer (Contract, $110-190/hr)",https://dribbble.com/jobs/99206-Product-Designer-Contract-110-190-hr?source=index,"A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only platform for senior product designers to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $7.3+ million since.As part of A·Team, you can expect: High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. A·Team is picky, and only works with companies referred to us by top funds or existing members and clients such as Lyft, McGraw Hill, the former-CEO of Waze, a few new unicorns, and dozens of venture-backed startups by a16z, YC, Softbank, GC, etc. Keep 100% of what you make: we exist to empower independent builders, which is why A.Team charges a percentage on top of your standard rate. Do more with a team you like: our focus is on small, diverse, cross-functional teams of insanely talented developers, PMs, designers, growth leads, etc. This is because clients with bigger budgets & more ambitious work need teams to solve problems, not individuals to do tasks. That said, we try to keep friends together, since clients love builders who have worked together before. Full autonomy: we only want you to join teams when the timings right. Often they start around 15-20hrs/week, and last at least 3-6 months (longer if its going great, or contract-to-hire if true love is found). Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations you wouldnt have elsewhere & connecting with other top-tier builders who you may like to collaborate with. How to apply:Go here: https://build.a.team/dribbble + mention Dribbble under how did you hear about A·Team? No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were super interested in seeing what youve made, so drop in a link to your Dribbble profile. Excited to chat more real soon if there’s a fit.What you’ll do: Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. Who A·Team is for: Senior product designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy. Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders. The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing Who A·Team is not for: People looking for small gigs Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet) Our long-term vision:A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apples Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Whartons Adam Grant, and Dukes Dan Ariely.",2023-06-21,Anywhere,2023-06-21 12:55:46.239156

Principal Product Designer,https://dribbble.com/jobs/212132-Principal-Product-Designer?source=index,"Modular Cloud is building the next-gen version of a product known as a “block explorer”. Blockchain data is typically hard to access and understand. Block explorers solve this problem by presenting the data on the web in a human-readable format.From a design perspective, our block explorer is different from others in the following ways: It is a power tool for developers. Think about how Superhuman revolutionized the UX of email. Or how Linear made mundane product management delightful. We want to create a similarly elevated experience for developers accessing blockchain data—allowing them to efficiently access what they need in the most enjoyable way possible. Our technology platform is customizable. There is no one-size-fits all. There are thousands blockchain protocols and smart contracts in existence. How can we craft a universal UI perfectly suited to each of these use cases? We can’t. Therefore, we are building programmability and customizability into our application. Everything is open source. Our designs and code will all be open to the public. While the company does maintain some proprietary IP, the block explorer is completely open. People can look at the designs, read the code, learn from it, use it, and run it locally. We want to give back to the community. This role is for the main designer at the company. As a result, these will be the responsibilities: Design strategy. How should we approach design given the company’s objectives? Creativity. This is a creative role. We deeply value this capacity. UI and UX. We need someone who can create beautiful, functional designs based on the needs of our users. This includes things like animated page transitions, custom icons, and building a design system. Wear many hats. Since this role is for our main designer, this person will also need to be able to help with designing landing pages, creating marketing assets, and managing design contractors. Branding. Although we will likely engage an outside agency for branding, we need our in-house designer to be a part of this process. Work closely with the founders. Modular Cloud is a small company that raised $1.7M in venture capital. This role will report directly to the CEO (who is also the frontend developer).

But here’s what AI may be able to help the world with: finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function. But, like humans, algorithms are what they eat. They’re only as good as the rules they know and the data they’re trained on. We’re the team that helps model these behaviors.The RoleAs an Expert AI Data Trainer, you will be working closely with a team of other expert trainers, with language models, within protocols developed by the world’s leading AI researchers— training the AI to solve complex problems or comprehend concepts using conversations in natural language. Think of it like being a subject matter expert and a coach influencing the way the AI model behaves and processes information in challenging or not so common situations.The goal of this AI is to be a safe, accurate, widely knowledgeable, and beneficial conversation partner to the world for a wide variety of purposes. Your job is to train, evaluate, and test the AI’s knowledge, capabilities and conversation skills, continuously to achieve its purpose.Experience Masters/PhD in one or more major areas (STEM or other sciences) Background in Math strongly preferred Coding/Programming experience Research experience Teaching experience strongly preferred Day in and day out, you will: You’ll spend the bulk of your time chatting with the AI, helping it analyze swaths of subject areas and distinguish between what is presented as fact vs. context vs. patterns of behavior. You will continuously evaluate the AI according to those criteria and our training methods. For example, you will be discerning the accuracy of the facts that the AI is outputting, but also the accuracy with which they interpret them. You’ll spend substantial amounts of time actively trying to “break” the AI by “forcing” mistakes and improving the way these AI models recover. This is absolutely critical to its safety, accuracy, and use. You’ll document breaks and have the opportunity to recommend improvements to the training methods themselves to both our team and our client. The PersonThis is a technology job that accommodates people from diverse educational and professional backgrounds but with a balanced mix of subject matter expertise, higher studies, research experience and teaching/tutoring experience. The role relies more on your competencies than your formal experience––making it a rare opportunity that’s perfect for those looking to apply their knowledge in the AI space, career transitioners, and those seeking an exciting encore career. You’re the sort of person who is exceptional at listening and reading for ground-level facts and intended meaning, and you can explain the inferences you made to link the two. Basically, you’ve got the metacognitive awareness to “show your work.” Compensation CareerCompensationThis role pays between $20-$30 / hour to top applicants anywhere in the world. The schedule is flexible and work is around 15-20 hours / week based on your availability.Life CareerThe work is steady, the hours are flexible, the work is enjoyable, and leaves room for advancement into more senior training roles and project management roles on the Invisible team as the project expands.

Elasticsearch consultant,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11264/elasticsearch-consultant-at-the-organized-crime-and-corruption-reporting-project-occrp/,"Application deadline: 30/06/2023About OCCRPThe Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a growing, global nonprofit media organization that is reinventing investigative journalism for the public good. By developing and equipping a global network of investigative journalists and publishing their stories, we expose crime and corruption so the public can hold power to account. We see a future where organized crime and corruption are drastically reduced and democracy is strengthened. Our global team includes editors, researchers, data engineers, security specialists, administrators, technologists, and strategists, each with areas of in-depth expertise.AlephTo support investigative journalists and member centers in their work to uncover corruption and hold power to account, OCCRP developed an investigative data platform called OCCRP Aleph. The platform serves as a central repository for exploring leaks, datasets and and data-dumps that are critical to effective investigative journalism. This platform now contains over 3 billion records and has served as a cornerstone in many global groundbreaking investigations. The platform allows journalists to ingest documents and both structured and unstructured data, and maps that data to an ontology that we developed called Follow the Money. Users can then search across all Aleph datasets to find connections, entities and cross-reference entities between datasets to uncover wrongdoing and patterns. This is largely possible through our use of Elasticsearch (ES), which is a central part of the application enabling rapid search through records. The platform that we’ve developed runs in a kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP. Our ES cluster comprises 21 Nodes including 3 master nodes. Each node uses a 2Tb SSD with 26Gb RAM and 4 vCPUs.The user-facing side of Aleph is written in Python and React with a Postgres database and an accompanying suite of CLI tools.The ProjectThe ChallengeAleph has now been in use for over seven years and in that time our ES index has grown significantly. The ES index is currently 30Tb and is increasing in size all the time. Although this growth is a testament to the success of the platform and the popularity of it with our users, it has brought with it very significant running costs.As such, the primary goal of this project is to investigate and optimize our current ES setup, in the hope of making it more space-efficient and cost effective and without impacting performance or usefulness of the platform for our users. Where you can helpAs an ElasticSearch expert, you will work closely with the Aleph development team to: ● Audit the current ElasticSearch implementation and propose possible tweaks and other ‘low-hanging-fruit’ changes we could make to improve cost efficiency. ● Understand the current ES setup and implementation and how it is tied into Aleph’s core functionality.● Investigate avenues for potential improvement of cost efficiency.● Propose architectural changes (small or large) to our ES implementation or Aleph as a whole that could significantly improve cost effectiveness without compromising performance.● Help us implement these changes (development, planning, architecture) when we know what they are.As the expert we’d expect you to make recommendations but there are several avenues that we’ve considered:● Optimizing our existing configuration to try and reduce the size of our index.● Setting up hot/cold nodes within the index for less frequently accessed data where longer retrieval time is more acceptable.● Refactoring the way in which data is split across indexes to allow better more efficient searches.● Setting up an archive process for taking data offline (and reducing the size of our index).What you bring to the table● Significant experience working with elasticsearch and ideally with performance and cost optimization.● Ideally experience working with an NGO● Solutions-oriented outlook and collaborative mindset to bring creative solutions to the tableHow to applyIf you’re interested in helping us with the project, either as an individual or as an organization we’d love to hear from you.For IndividualsIf you’re an individual interested in getting involved, please email us a copy of your CV along with a cover letter detailing your interest and daily rates to jobs(at)occrp.org Once we’re received this we’ll evaluate and reach out.For OrganizationsIf you’re an organization looking to provide us with professional services then please email us at jobs(at)occrp.org including information on your organization, your rates, availability, and why you believe that you are best placed to help us, and we’ll arrange a time to talk.All applications must be submitted in English.

Workforces are now distributed and no longer office-based every day, meaning that yesterdays commuter has become tomorrows business traveler. Having up-to-date data to decide whether to meet in person, virtually or in a hybrid format is a must-have for companies of any size; however, this has been available to access dynamically from a single source just now, the TROOP.As companies focus on their environmental commitments, they are turning to TROOP to help guide their teams as they aim to keep to carbon targets.The purpose of a meeting is more important than ever to understand, and when approving a meeting, the costs and time spent traveling are key data to inform this investment decision.Staff wellness is vital to optimizing performance in todays workforce. Understanding the impact on staff when planning a meeting by understanding the range of time zones people are attending and the time spent traveling to participate in the meeting allows for more thoughtful scheduling and choice of location. We have ambitious goals to be the leading solution in introducing an end-to-end experience, including booking, taking our data to where the conversation is being had, and much more.TROOPs CultureOur culture is built on an African philosophy called Ubuntu, which means I am because we are.

But here’s what AI may be able to help the world with: finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function.
