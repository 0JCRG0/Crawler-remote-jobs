"Product Designer (Contract, $110-190/hr)",https://dribbble.com/jobs/99206-Product-Designer-Contract-110-190-hr?source=index,"A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only platform for senior product designers to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $7.3+ million since.As part of A·Team, you can expect: High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. A·Team is picky, and only works with companies referred to us by top funds or existing members and clients such as Lyft, McGraw Hill, the former-CEO of Waze, a few new unicorns, and dozens of venture-backed startups by a16z, YC, Softbank, GC, etc. Keep 100% of what you make: we exist to empower independent builders, which is why A.Team charges a percentage on top of your standard rate. Do more with a team you like: our focus is on small, diverse, cross-functional teams of insanely talented developers, PMs, designers, growth leads, etc. This is because clients with bigger budgets & more ambitious work need teams to solve problems, not individuals to do tasks. That said, we try to keep friends together, since clients love builders who have worked together before. Full autonomy: we only want you to join teams when the timings right. Often they start around 15-20hrs/week, and last at least 3-6 months (longer if its going great, or contract-to-hire if true love is found). Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations you wouldnt have elsewhere & connecting with other top-tier builders who you may like to collaborate with. How to apply:Go here: https://build.a.team/dribbble + mention Dribbble under how did you hear about A·Team? No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. Were super interested in seeing what youve made, so drop in a link to your Dribbble profile. Excited to chat more real soon if there’s a fit.What you’ll do: Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. Who A·Team is for: Senior product designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy. Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders. The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing Who A·Team is not for: People looking for small gigs Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet) Our long-term vision:A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them unhirables: people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apples Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Whartons Adam Grant, and Dukes Dan Ariely.",2023-07-20,Anywhere,2023-07-20 22:10:52.619326

Principal Product Designer,https://dribbble.com/jobs/212132-Principal-Product-Designer?source=index,"Modular Cloud is building the next-gen version of a product known as a “block explorer”. Blockchain data is typically hard to access and understand. Block explorers solve this problem by presenting the data on the web in a human-readable format.From a design perspective, our block explorer is different from others in the following ways: It is a power tool for developers. Think about how Superhuman revolutionized the UX of email. Or how Linear made mundane product management delightful. We want to create a similarly elevated experience for developers accessing blockchain data—allowing them to efficiently access what they need in the most enjoyable way possible. Our technology platform is customizable. There is no one-size-fits all. There are thousands blockchain protocols and smart contracts in existence. How can we craft a universal UI perfectly suited to each of these use cases? We can’t. Therefore, we are building programmability and customizability into our application. Everything is open source. Our designs and code will all be open to the public. While the company does maintain some proprietary IP, the block explorer is completely open. People can look at the designs, read the code, learn from it, use it, and run it locally. We want to give back to the community. This role is for the main designer at the company. As a result, these will be the responsibilities: Design strategy. How should we approach design given the company’s objectives? Creativity. This is a creative role. We deeply value this capacity. UI and UX. We need someone who can create beautiful, functional designs based on the needs of our users. This includes things like animated page transitions, custom icons, and building a design system. Wear many hats. Since this role is for our main designer, this person will also need to be able to help with designing landing pages, creating marketing assets, and managing design contractors. Branding. Although we will likely engage an outside agency for branding, we need our in-house designer to be a part of this process. Work closely with the founders. Modular Cloud is a small company that raised $1.7M in venture capital. This role will report directly to the CEO (who is also the frontend developer). Qualifications Evidence of exceptional ability (portfolio or work experience) No blockchain familiarity needed Thinks working hard is a good thing",2023-07-20,Remote,2023-07-20 22:10:57.381661

"Research Engineer (Prototyping), GitHub Next",https://himalayas.app/companies/github/jobs/research-engineer-prototyping-github-next-9499774622,"GitHub has changed the way software is built, and we have a unique opportunity to look further ahead to identify how software development can be faster, safer, easier, and more accessible. We’re looking for talented, experienced polymaths to join us in this mission! This is the rare role that affords both startup-level agency and a larger company’s resources.Our team, GitHub Next, has incubated genre-defining products like Copilot, the new GitHub Code Search, and more. You’ll work closely with a small group of experienced and talented researchers to explore the future of software development. Our team’s prototypes inform GitHub’s leadership and roadmap. Each exploration represents a risky bet that GitHub might want to make, and we have to support those bets with working prototypes.Please note that this is not an academic research role. Our job is to dream big and then build it. Our team feels like a permanent startup — every time we succeed, we hand off our prototypes and return to the drawing board to do it all over again.You can see many of our projects at GitHub Next..Responsibilities:Research Engineers conduct investigations and build prototypes. Sometimes, we have an interesting technological idea but need to figure out how to turn it into a reliable product. Other times, we dream of an experience, but we’re not sure how to make that experience a reality. With few constraints on our solution space, our hardest task is figuring out how to scope our bets and deliver value. We will have more ideas than we can possibly pursue; choosing wisely is part of the job.The exploration domains are varied and will require an ability to understand, investigate, and implement prototypes across a wide range of technologies. Our team has a lot of different skills under one roof, and we work together in squads to identify and debate ideas, then execute everything needed for a working prototype.Minimum Qualifications: 8+ years experience building and shipping software using a variety of technology stacks, or equivalent experience Experience identifying and justifying research goals in situations of ambiguity and executing towards those goals without explicit direction Experience creating rapid prototypes that demonstrate a concept to stakeholders and enable decision making Preferred Qualifications:These are more specific abilities we’re looking for, but it is the rare human who possesses them all. Think of this as a descriptive sketch, not a checklist of requirements. Be comfortable applying even if you don’t have all of them. A deep understanding of GitHub’s industry and business context and the ability to articulate topics related to our product and audience Has held roles that deal with topics at the boundary of human knowledge regarding software development and developers Have significant experience with one or more frontend technologies. We currently default to Typescript and React for the web and a range of technologies on the backend, but “whatever enables us to ship” is the top concern Have significant experience with machine learning, LLMs, and the rapidly-evolving landscape of techniques and tools used to build intelligence into products Have significant experience with one or more backend technologies: server-side environments, compute, datastores, networking, infrastructure, devops, security, and programming languages Have significant experience with open-source software, communities, and the systems these communities use to self-organize and ship software for others Have significant experience operating production systems at a nontrivial scale and are familiar with the common patterns and pitfalls of that work Have significant experience in another area of computing that is relevant to our mission. Human-computer interaction, distributed systems, $YOURTHING You may be a good fit if: You are a generalist with some areas of deeper knowledge. Hybrids will feel at home on this team. We will also consider candidates who have specialized in a relevant field. You are an effective and inclusive communicator, comfortable with remote communication practices. Next’s currency is ideas; the health of our team, our execution, and our results rests on our ability to communicate well. You are comfortable collaborating with teammates to figure out what work needs doing, then splitting up that work and doing it. Ideating alone is natural and common, but projects staffed by one individual are not. Your teammates are the first ones you must persuade with your ideas. You are comfortable reading source code. You are comfortable picking up new technology stacks in the normal course of work. This is a senior engineering role! While we do have some technologies that we generally like to use, we are not indexing on a specific stack. Experience is more than your ability to write code in language X or framework Y. Minimum salary of $118,100 to maximum $313,300.In addition, certain roles also have the opportunity to earn sales incentives based on revenue or utilization, depending on the terms of the plan and the employees role.These pay ranges are intended to cover roles based across the United States.

Software Engineer,https://himalayas.app/companies/warp/jobs/software-engineer-190592654,"The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done. We are looking for outstanding product-focused software engineers who want to work on re-imagining a product that we developers use every day. As an Engineer at Warp, youll have the chance to tackle difficult technical problems. One of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that, for historical reasons, the terminal/shell division makes it hard to innovate. Youll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one! Also, as a foundational member of our early team, youll be instrumental in shaping our company culture and long-term engineering practices.🎥 Here’s a quick 3-min video of Zach Lloyd, our founder and CEO, giving an overview of the product and the company: https://www.loom.com/share/b2824d2c8cd649faa466d6ca2a770939As a Software Engineer, you will… Participate in all aspects of software development activities, including design, coding, code review, unit/integration testing, bug fixing, and code/API documentation. Collaborate closely with the rest of engineering, as well as other stakeholders from our growth, marketing, and product teams, to plan features and build a high quality product that elevates the productivity of all developers. Improve Warps performance and reliability by building new features or polishing existing parts of the product. Fast prototyping of ideas and concepts and researching the latest industry trends. Work across the entire technical stack to ensure users have the most efficient and delightful experience using Warp. The features you develop will span all aspects of the user experience, making you an expert on what their needs are. Be a mentor and provide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and build strong personal connections with your teammates! You may be a good fit if... You are passionate about helping developers get more done — would jump at the chance to work on this particular product You have amazing engineering chops, but are also product- and user-focused You have great communication and collaboration skills You’re sensitive to developers’ needs, and can develop warm relationships with developers Bonus: Building native apps in Rust or WASM Shell or Linux-programming OpenGL, WebG, or other graphics programming Building open-source software At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you’re excited about this role, but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.Salary TransparencyTotal compensation at Warp consists of two parts: 1) a competitive base salary, and most importantly, 2) meaningful equity.When we find the right person, we try to put our best foot forward with an offer that excites you. We consider what you’d like to be paid, the skills and level of experience you bring, what similar jobs pay, and make sure there’s equal pay for equal work among those you’ll be working with. The budgeted compensation amount for this role is targeted at $145,000 - $260,000. In addition to salary, all employees receive further compensation in the form of equity in the company. This is a meaningful stock option grant with a four-year vesting period and one-year cliff. Your equity is where most of the significant upside potential is. Comparing startup equity is always a bit tricky, so we’re happy to walk you through different valuation scenarios at the offer stage in order to help paint a clearer picture of the upside. Final total compensation is determined by multiple factors including your experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. What We Offer Competitive Salary Meaningful Equity – we will stretch to get the right talent on board Full Medical, Dental and Vision Benefits Flexible remote-first culture, with optional WeWork in SF and an office space in NYC for folks who want to work together IRL 20-days of Paid Time Off 12 US Holidays Twice-a-year company retreats Monthly gym stipend 401(k) Pre-Tax FSA Health Savings Plan Complimentary OneMedical membership Individuals seeking employment at Warp are considered without regards to race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation. About Warp We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world. We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you’re interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide. We’re very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. In October 2021, we closed a $17M Series A ($23M total raised), led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce). The Product Heres a quick demo showing some of our current features… This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don’t exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more. The Opportunity The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships. To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer’s shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We’ll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects. At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers. A couple college students, totally unprompted, wrote a piece on why new students should work at Warp as part of their new newsletter they are launching called Why You Should Join. Its an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis.

Elasticsearch consultant,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11264/elasticsearch-consultant-at-the-organized-crime-and-corruption-reporting-project-occrp/,"Application deadline: 30/06/2023About OCCRPThe Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a growing, global nonprofit media organization that is reinventing investigative journalism for the public good. By developing and equipping a global network of investigative journalists and publishing their stories, we expose crime and corruption so the public can hold power to account. We see a future where organized crime and corruption are drastically reduced and democracy is strengthened. Our global team includes editors, researchers, data engineers, security specialists, administrators, technologists, and strategists, each with areas of in-depth expertise.AlephTo support investigative journalists and member centers in their work to uncover corruption and hold power to account, OCCRP developed an investigative data platform called OCCRP Aleph. The platform serves as a central repository for exploring leaks, datasets and and data-dumps that are critical to effective investigative journalism. This platform now contains over 3 billion records and has served as a cornerstone in many global groundbreaking investigations. The platform allows journalists to ingest documents and both structured and unstructured data, and maps that data to an ontology that we developed called Follow the Money. Users can then search across all Aleph datasets to find connections, entities and cross-reference entities between datasets to uncover wrongdoing and patterns. This is largely possible through our use of Elasticsearch (ES), which is a central part of the application enabling rapid search through records. The platform that we’ve developed runs in a kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP. Our ES cluster comprises 21 Nodes including 3 master nodes. Each node uses a 2Tb SSD with 26Gb RAM and 4 vCPUs.The user-facing side of Aleph is written in Python and React with a Postgres database and an accompanying suite of CLI tools.The ProjectThe ChallengeAleph has now been in use for over seven years and in that time our ES index has grown significantly. The ES index is currently 30Tb and is increasing in size all the time. Although this growth is a testament to the success of the platform and the popularity of it with our users, it has brought with it very significant running costs.As such, the primary goal of this project is to investigate and optimize our current ES setup, in the hope of making it more space-efficient and cost effective and without impacting performance or usefulness of the platform for our users. Where you can helpAs an ElasticSearch expert, you will work closely with the Aleph development team to: ● Audit the current ElasticSearch implementation and propose possible tweaks and other ‘low-hanging-fruit’ changes we could make to improve cost efficiency. ● Understand the current ES setup and implementation and how it is tied into Aleph’s core functionality.● Investigate avenues for potential improvement of cost efficiency.● Propose architectural changes (small or large) to our ES implementation or Aleph as a whole that could significantly improve cost effectiveness without compromising performance.● Help us implement these changes (development, planning, architecture) when we know what they are.As the expert we’d expect you to make recommendations but there are several avenues that we’ve considered:● Optimizing our existing configuration to try and reduce the size of our index.● Setting up hot/cold nodes within the index for less frequently accessed data where longer retrieval time is more acceptable.● Refactoring the way in which data is split across indexes to allow better more efficient searches.● Setting up an archive process for taking data offline (and reducing the size of our index).What you bring to the table● Significant experience working with elasticsearch and ideally with performance and cost optimization.● Ideally experience working with an NGO● Solutions-oriented outlook and collaborative mindset to bring creative solutions to the tableHow to applyIf you’re interested in helping us with the project, either as an individual or as an organization we’d love to hear from you.For IndividualsIf you’re an individual interested in getting involved, please email us a copy of your CV along with a cover letter detailing your interest and daily rates to jobs(at)occrp.org Once we’re received this we’ll evaluate and reach out.For OrganizationsIf you’re an organization looking to provide us with professional services then please email us at jobs(at)occrp.org including information on your organization, your rates, availability, and why you believe that you are best placed to help us, and we’ll arrange a time to talk.All applications must be submitted in English.

Managing Director,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11227/managing-director-at-matrixorg-foundation/,"The Matrix.org Foundation is a non-profit UK Community Interest Company that serves as both a guardian and champion of Matrix, an open standard and protocol for real-time communication that is used by an ever-growing global community. Matrix is to communicating in the 21st century what e-mail was to sending messages in the 20th – an interoperable and federated protocol that makes it possible for anyone, anywhere in the world, to connect to users anywhere on the global network in a safe, reliable manner. While work on Matrix began in 2014, today ongoing development of the specification is entrusted to the Foundation, currently led by a group of five Guardians who keep a watchful eye on the Matrix Spec Core Team and its work, making sure the community stays true to its overall philosophy. To date, most of the work of the Foundation has been provided through in-kind efforts of ecosystem leaders, such as Element. These contributions have included general outreach and advocacy for Matrix, operation of the massively popular Matrix.org homeserver, and funding software development for projects including end-to-end encryption, client SDKs and Synapse, the Matrix reference homeserver implementation. While these external contributions have been and remain critical, the Foundation takes seriously its responsibility to the long-term success of Matrix, and so recently began to transition into a more direct and hands-on role in key areas. The Role As we begin to prepare for the 2nd decade of Matrix and respond to the community’s rapid growth, the Foundation is seeking its first Managing Director to: (a) build support for the evolution of the ecosystem of service providers and software developers building technology and services on the Matrix protocol, (b) to oversee development and operations of key technology infrastructure and community resources, and © to help ensure the Foundation’s fiscal sustainability for the long term in order to provide stability and assurance to users and contributors. This role is responsible for strategy, operations, and fundraising for the Foundation in service to the larger Matrix community. The role reports to the newly-forming Matrix Governing Board via the long-established committee of Guardians who have deep ongoing experience with the ecosystem’s history, successes, and challenges. The person in this role will also initially be responsible for taking over certain tasks from predecessor volunteers and outsourced providers, including such tasks as annual tax & reporting filings, maintenance of the Foundation’s online presence, and overseeing key community events/programs/activities (conferences, participation in standards groups, Google Summer of Code, etc.). Requirements The Foundation’s inaugural Managing Director will have an especially critical responsibility to design strategic plans, operational approaches, and help to build a culture that is aligned with the long-term goals of the Matrix community and to the extent possible supports its work in all its forms. You will not only need to build the plans for the future of the Foundation, you will also be responsible to raise funds to execute those plans, and then transform those plans into reality through building internal teams and ecosystem partnerships. Specifically, we are looking for someone who is: * Intellectually and emotionally smart, naturally curious, and deeply enthusiastic about our mission. * A compelling and articulate communicator (both in written form and through public speaking) who takes great pleasure in helping others be successful. * Empathetic, with not only Matrix ecosystem members, but also users and potential supporters. * Comfortable with the pace, trade offs, and ambiguity of an early stage non-profit organization, and who remembers how to balance their own self-care alongside caring for and supporting others in our community. * Comfortable “wearing many hats” and taking on a variety of roles temporarily as the organization builds its team. * Not afraid to explain to people that changing the world takes both resources and money, and to enthusiastically solicit financial support for the Foundation in doing so. Your experience First and foremost, we are looking for someone who is deeply passionate about the Matrix mission for democratising communication, and who will be an outspoken advocate for our work. We also need someone with not only deep experience in building organizations and communities, but also in organizational development work such as fundraising and partnership building. We expect the successful candidate to have the following experience: * Past experience building a fundraising pipeline to support annual operating budgets. Based on the desired activities of the Foundation, our target annual budgets will be in the $4-5M range. * Existing access to a wide network of funding organizations and comfort making contact with new organizations to build relationships and solicit support. * Experience leading free and open source software projects. * Experience with implementing and supporting back-office technology such as project management tools, CRM (for members management) and fundraising campaign software. The following attributes will make your application stand out even more: Experience with software development practices (e.g. coding, QA, design, management) will help to understand the needs and challenges of Matrix contributors. Hands-on experience with the Matrix project, such as software development or running your own homeserver, would help you to better understand some of the practical issues and roadmap for Matrix. Technical experience with other real-time messaging platforms would be helpful for the same reasons. * We are a global project and expect to work with community members, partners, and donors in multiple countries. So past experience working with colleagues across multiple countries, as is fluency in multiple written and spoken languages. Benefits This position is designed to be remote. Most of your colleagues will be located in Europe, so you should be willing and able to readily communicate in those time zones. As the first official role directly serving the Foundation, we are opening this role as an independent contractor/consultant relationship in order to provide maximum flexibility in the early phase of the newly-energized organization. As is the case with most new organizations yet to name a leader, funding is currently limited but we will work to both provide flexibility to the right person, and to provide fair compensation that is competitive with other similar opportunities qualified candidates may have. Depending on a candidate’s needs and situation, we may also be able to offer a direct hire relationship if needed. Because this role will be the first paid role in the organization, employee benefits are not yet established. However, once recurring funding is secured the Foundation’s current leadership is committed to a budget and building revenue sources that will accommodate a competitive benefits package for all employees, including retirement savings, allowances for workspace costs, paid leave, and healthcare benefits as necessary. The Matrix.org Foundation does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, colour, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits. How To Apply If you are interested in this role and think you might be qualified, we encourage you to get in touch with us. We especially encourage people subject to systematic bias or impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry to apply. Even if you don’t check every item in this job description, if you meet some of the core criteria and are eager and able to take on the role’s responsibilities, we would like to hear from you. Please send a CV or resume of your relevant experience, contact information (including a Matrix ID if you have one!), and a one-page cover letter describing why you think you might be a good fit for this role. We will contact those candidates who are short-listed on a rolling basis as we receive application materials, so please don’t delay in applying. We may request examples of your past relevant work in order to better understand how your experience would work in our organization. The Matrix.org Foundation is eager to have a new leader as soon as possible, and the Matrix community is ready to grow with this role’s support!",2023-07-20,Worldwide Remote,2023-07-20 22:10:31.832503

Senior Front-End Engineer (Vue3)at Trooptravel,https://vuejobs.com/jobs/trooptravel-senior-front-end-engineer-vue3-clone-2,"What is TROOP, and why should I care?It all starts with the question, “Where do we meet?”:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd42BB6Pe8ETROOP is a data aggregation and visualization technology that helps corporations identify the best meeting location in minutes using real-time data rather than opinions.Why TROOP?TROOP is on a mission to reinvent meeting planning, taking an inefficient, drawn-out, and laborious process today and making it simple and quick for anyone to organize a meeting. Workforces are now distributed and no longer office-based every day, meaning that yesterdays commuter has become tomorrows business traveler. Having up-to-date data to decide whether to meet in person, virtually or in a hybrid format is a must-have for companies of any size; however, this has been available to access dynamically from a single source just now, the TROOP.As companies focus on their environmental commitments, they are turning to TROOP to help guide their teams as they aim to keep to carbon targets.The purpose of a meeting is more important than ever to understand, and when approving a meeting, the costs and time spent traveling are key data to inform this investment decision.Staff wellness is vital to optimizing performance in todays workforce. Understanding the impact on staff when planning a meeting by understanding the range of time zones people are attending and the time spent traveling to participate in the meeting allows for more thoughtful scheduling and choice of location. We have ambitious goals to be the leading solution in introducing an end-to-end experience, including booking, taking our data to where the conversation is being had, and much more.TROOPs CultureOur culture is built on an African philosophy called Ubuntu, which means I am because we are.

We know we’ll only achieve our mission by hiring and engaging a diverse staff that reflects the communities in which we work. Recognizing that people bring talent and skills that have been developed outside the scope of a job, we take a holistic approach to recruitment that considers life experience in addition to the professional requirements listed in our postings. Please apply we’d love to hear from you. To quote a popular saying at TNC, you’ll join for the mission, and you’ll stay for the people. WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER The Global Strategies Climate Advisor will focus on supporting the design and development of climate outcomes as part of two key global strategies/partnerships (Nature Bonds, and Project Finance for Permanence or PFP / Enduring Earth) led by the Global Protect Lands, Oceans, and Waters Team. The Science and Strategy Advisor will sit on the Global Climate team but will be embedded within strategy and project teams sponsored by the Global Protect team. The Science and Strategy advisor must have a strong science and practice understanding of nature-based solutions for adaptation and mitigation, including as they relate to human well-being and equity. The advisor will advise governments, partners, and internal TNC staff on how to integrate critical climate considerations into conservation projects and related agreements. Nature Bonds and Project Finance for Permanence are two strategic pathways that aim to deliver large-scale conservation wins to meet the organization’s 2030 goals in a One Conservancy’ approach: Nature Bonds secures durable conservation outcomes by refinancing countries’ sovereign debt to generate new funding and bringing policy, stakeholder engagement, science and planning in support of governments’ ambitious conservation and climate commitments, such as the Blue Bond in Belize. Project Finance for Permanence (PFP) / Enduring Earth is an ambitious collaboration that works alongside nations as they accelerate and amplify conservation for a more sustainable, prosperous future for people and planet. PFPs are an innovative and proven model that fully funds conservation projects to ensure durable and scalable impact. Through a combination of partnerships, permanent funding and local leadership, we strengthen biodiversity, reinforce the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, reduce the effects of climate change, and catalyze economic growth.

The position will require a rigorous understanding of the Global Climate team strategic approaches to mitigation and adaptation as well as an understanding of carbon accounting, equitable conservation, and natural climate solution pathways and their mitigation potential.

The Business Context You already use AI in many ways like deciding what products and services to order and it may be most familiar to you as a chatbot, as an avatar-maker, or as a way to unlock your screen. But here’s what AI may be able to help the world with finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function.
