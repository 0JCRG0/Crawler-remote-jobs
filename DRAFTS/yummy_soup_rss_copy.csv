person for this role is a generalist and an ongoing student of marketing You may have come up through content product marketing or growth but your focus is on finding the bottlenecks of growth and tackling them with whatever tools you have at your disposal With that said here are a few of the ongoing marketing practices you might get involved in  Content After shifting to a freemium model Podias content focus has changed With free accounts the key driver of topoffunnel leads theres less pressure on content to generate leads and more opportunity to drive revenue with a targeted approach to content  LifecycleInapp Podia has some lifecycle in place for freepaid users inactive users and people who take actions in the app  but theres substantial opportunity to get more sophisticated  Community Podias Creator Community has several thousand members and is more active than most SaaS communities But the nature of the creator market means theres still a ton of opportunity to grow  AffiliatesPartnerships The affiliate program relaunched last year and has grown quickly Partnerships with other creator companies have recently begun and are showing promise  CampaignsPrograms Podia

determine your teams contribution to the business overall growth strategy For the right person this could be a dream job Youll have a ton of creative freedom and youll work on things that are just straight up cool At the same time the role isnt for everyone Marketing at Podia isnt a service organization and theres no paintbynumbers There are no traffic targets SEO outside of targeted
